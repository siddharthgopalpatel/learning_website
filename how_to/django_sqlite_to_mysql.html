<h4> <pre>
<h3>Complete process of changing database from SQLite to MySQL</h3>
-> One of the main benefit to use django for web development is that it comes with an inbuilt database/filesystem i.e SQLITE. 
-> Managing database and files is super easy in django. 
-> But there are some drawbacks of using SQLITE. 
-> If your website has a minimum traffic of about 100-200 per day OR you have 1000-2000 files (or more obviously) in your database, then the problems start rising. 
-> SQLITE gives amazing performance if your data is upto 2GB (can vary with your file types & size). 
-> Thus, you can not handle large traffic efficiently by using SQLITE.

<u>Here are some advantages & disadvantages of using SQLITE:</u>
Advantages :
1) Sqlite is Lightweight.
2) No Installation Needed.
3) Portable & reliable

Disadvantages :
1) SQLite is used to handle low to medium traffic.
2) Database size is restricted upto 2GB (in most cases).

-> let's see how you can migrate db from SQLITE to MySQL in 6 simple steps. 

<u>Step 1</u>
-> Create the docker environment and get the access of it
   git clone https://gitlab.com/patelsiddharthnids993/automation_devops; cd automation_devops
   python3 test.py -T django -A create
   python3 test.py -T django -A connect
-> Clone one of the Django project, run it and check whether it is working good.    
   git clone https://gitlab.com/meghachandsingh/ipl_project && cd ipl_project
   python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
-> Access it from webpage by &lt;server-ip&gt;:8000

<u>Step 2</u>
-> You need to install mysql-server and start it. For that run the below commands -
   apt update
   apt install mysql-server -y
   service mysql status
   service mysql start 
   service mysql status  
-> Connect to mysql and set the root password.
   mysql
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'Test12345@';
   exit
-> Now, do mysql secure installation(give the same password as above for root and other options as default i.e. hit enter)
   mysql_secure_installation
-> Connect to mysql again, and create db
   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE Sidd;
   exit
 
<u>Step 3</u>
-> First of all make a zip file of your whole website folder for backup security purpose (highly recommended).
-> Dump all data from SQlite in a json file using the following command.
   python3 manage.py dumpdata > datadump.json
-> Just go to the working directory (in the virtual environment) and run the above command. The execution may takes time depends upon database size.
-> Please try ,not to close console untill the final step.

<u>Step 4</u>
-> Now install mysqlclient and its depedencies by using following command. This is nothing but a connector for python with mysql.
   apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev -y
   python3 -m pip install mysqlclient

<u>Step 3</u>
-> Now you have to make some changes in settings.py file. Search for a dictionary named as "DATABASES" and replace it with the following code.
   vi project/settings.py

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'Sidd',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'Test12345@',
        #'HOST': 'mysql_host_name',
        #'PORT': '3306',
        'OPTION': {'init_command': 'set storage_engine=InnoDB; set session transaction isolation level read committed'},
    }
}

-> Make sure you can connect on your mysql DB (permissions,etc) i.e check the details carefully before proceeding.
-> Note that the OPTION may have more parameters. You can check the django documentation(https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/databases/) for more values, but if you keep it as it is above there will be no issue.

<u>Step 4</u>
-> Run the following command to make synchronization among the database tables and the model settings.
   python3 manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
-> You can ignore the warnings that pop-ups in console (if any)

<u>Step 5</u>
-> This is the main step, you have to remove old content types to save data in MySQL fields which may uses different content types.
-> Exclude contentype data with this snippet in shell.
python3 manage.py shell
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
ContentType.objects.all().delete()
quit()

<u>Step 6</u>
-> This is the final step. Everything now all set , the database ,settingse etc. 
-> Now we have to write or store the data from the json file which we saved in our very first step. 
-> For this purpose run the following command :
   python3 manage.py loaddata datadump.json
-> Now run the Django program again, and check whether data from the user is getting updated in mysql table.
   python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

<u>Tips</u>
-> If you face any problem for example if you have any app like sorl-thumbnail or easy-thumbnail in your INSTALLED_APPS ,sometimes a file(thumbnail) is not present in media files which makes the last step incomplete. 
-> The point is if you face any issue just read the error location and the app/module which is causing error. 
-> Then replace the website data from our back-up file(that is why i recommended to make a backup zip file of whole website) and remove that app from INSTALLED_APPS (run migrate command if required).
-> Now you have to perform all the steps again.
