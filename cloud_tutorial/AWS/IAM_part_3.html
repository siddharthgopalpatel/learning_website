<html><h2><u><center>Identity Federation</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> If your account users already have a way to be authenticated such as authentication through your corporate network.
-> You can federate those user identities into AWS.
-> A user who has already logged to the corporate using their corporate Identity.
-> The corporate can replace their existing identity with a temporary identity in your AWS account.
-> This user can work in the AWS management console.
-> Similarly, an application that the user is working with can make programmatic request using permissions that you define. 

<h3><u>Federation is particularly useful in these cases -</u></h3>
1. Your users already have identities in a corporate directory.
-> If your corporate directory is compatible with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0)
-> You can configure your corporate directory to provide single sign-on (SSO) access to the AWS Management console for your users.
-> If your corporate directory is not compatible with SAML 2.0
-> You can create Identity Broker application to provide single sign-on (SSO) access to the AWS management console for your users.
-> If your corporate directory is Microsoft Active Directory, you can use AWS Directory Service to establish trust between your corporate directory and your AWS account.

2. Your users already have internet identities
-> If you are creating a mobile app or web-based app that can let users identity themselves through an Internet Identity Provider like login with Amazon, Facebook, Google or 
   any Open ID Connect (OIDC) compatible identity provider, the app can use Web Federation to access AWS.

-> AWS recommends to use AWS Cognito for Identity Federation.

Note:
-> SAML => Corporate, OpenID Connect => Web Federation

<html><h2><u><center>IAM part three</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
<h3><u>Federated Users and Roles</u></h3>
-> Federated user don't have permanent identities in your AWS account the way that IAM users do.
-> To assign permissions to federated users you can create an entity referred to as a 'role' and define permission for the role.
-> When a federated user sign-in to AWS, the user is associated with the role and is granted the permission that are defined in the role.

<h3><u>IAM Users and SSO</u></h3>
-> IAM users in your account have access only to the AWS resources that you specify in the policy that is attached to the user or to an IAM group that the user belongs to.
-> To work in the console, user must have permissions to perform the actions that the console performs, such as listing and creating AWS resources. 

<h3><u>IAM Temporary Credentials</u></h3>
-> Temporary credentials are primarily used with IAM roles, but there are also other users.
-> You can request temporary credentials that have a more restricted set of permissions than your standard IAM users.
-> This prevent you from accidentally performing task that are not permitted by the more restricted credentials.
-> A benefit of temporary credentials is that they expire automatically after set period of time.
