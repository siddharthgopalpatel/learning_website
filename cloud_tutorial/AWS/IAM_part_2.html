   c. Role
2. Policy

<u>1. IAM Entity</u>
-> IAM identities are what you create under your AWS account to provide authentication for people, applications and processes in your AWS account.
-> Identities represent the user and can be authenticated and then authorized to perform actions in AWS.
-> Each of these can be associated with one or more policies to determine what actions a user, role or member of a group can do with which resources and user what conditions.
-> IAM group is a collection of users.
-> IAM role is very similar to IAM user.

<u>a. User</u>
-> An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS. It represents the person or service who uses the IAM user to interact with AWS.
-> You can create 10 users at a time.
-> An IAM user can represent an actual person or an application that requires AWS access to perform actions on AWS resources.
-> A primary use of IAM users is to give people the ability to sign-in to the AWS management console for interactive task and to make programmatic request to AWS services 
   using the API or CLI. 
-> IAM users are global entities, like an AWS account is today. No region is required to be specified when you define user permission. Users can use AWS services in any 
   Geographical region.
   
 For any user, you can assign them -
-> A username and password to access the AWS console.
-> An access key (access key ID and secret key) that they use for programmatic access (issuing request) to your AWS services using API and CLI.
-> You assign either or both based on the user activities and needs.
-> You can view and download your secret access key only when you create the access key. You cannot view or recover a secret access key later. If you lose your secret access key, you can create a new access key.
-> The newly created IAM users have no password and no access key. You need to create the user password.
-> You must create the type of credentials for an IAM user based on what the user will be doing.
-> You can grant user permissions by attaching IAM policies to them directly or making them members of IAM group where they inherit the group policies and permissions.
-> Each IAM user is associated with one and only one AWS account.
-> Users are defined within your account, so users do not have to do the payment. Bill would be paid by the parent account. 

<u>b. Group</u>
-> An IAM group is collection of IAM users.
-> It is a way to assign permission/policies to multiple users at once.
-> Use Groups to specify permissions for a collection of users, which can make those permissions easier to manage for those users.
-> For eg - you could have a group called HR and give that Group the types of permissions that HR department typically needs.
-> Any user in that group automatically has the permission that are assigned to the group.
-> If a new user joins your organization and should have HR privileged, you can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to that group.
-> If a person changes job in your organization, instead of editing that user's permission, you can remove him or her from the old groups and add him or her to the 
   appropriate new groups.

IAM Group Limitations 
-> A group is not truly an 'identity' in IAM because it cannot be indented as a principal in a permission policy.
-> Groups can't be nested.
-> You have a limit of 300 groups in an AWS account.
-> A user can be a member of upto 10 IAM groups.

<u>c. Role</u>
-> An IAM role is very similar to a user, in that it is an identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.
-> An IAM role does not have any credentials (password and access key) associated with it.
-> Instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.
-> An IAM user can assume a role to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task.
-> An IAM role can be assigned to a federated user who signs-in by using an external identity provider instead of IAM.    
`
<u>2. Policy</u> 
  Permissions and Policies
    -> The access management portion of AWS identity and access management (IAM) helps you to define that what a user or other entity is allowed to do in an account, often 
       referred to as authorization.
    -> Permissions are granted through policies that are created and then attached to users, groups and roles.

  Users and Policies
    -> By default, IAM users can't access anything in your account.
    -> You grant permissions to a user by creating a policy, which is a document that defines the effect, actions, resource and optional conditions.
    -> Any actions or resources that are not explicitly allowed are denied by default. 

  IAM Multiple Policies
    -> Users or groups can have multiple policies attached to them that grant different permission.
    -> In the case of multiple policies attached to a user (or a group), the user's permission are calculated based on the combination of policies.

There are different type of Policies in AWS, mentioned Resource Based Policy and Identity Based Policy below. 

<u>Resource Based Policy</u>

-> In some cases (like S3 bucket), you can attach a policy to a resource in addition to attaching in to a group or user. This is called a Resource Based Policy.
-> A Resource Based Policy contains slightly different information then a user-based Policy.
-> In a Resource Based Policy you specify what actions are permitted and what resources is affected.
-> You also explicitly list who is allowed access to the resource ( a Principal).
-> Resource based policies include a principal element that specifies who is granted the permissions.  
-> Principal will be mentioned only in Resource based policy not on identity based policy.

<u>Identity Based Policy</u>
 
-> You can create a new IAM policy in the AWS management console using one of the following ways -
1. Json 
   - You can create your own JSON syntax.

2. Visual Editor
   - You can construct a new policy from scratch in the visual editor.
   - If you use the visual editor, you do not have to understand JSON syntax.

3. Import
   - You can import a managed policy within your account and then edit the policy to customize it to your specific requirement.
