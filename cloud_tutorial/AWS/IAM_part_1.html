<html><h2><u><center>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> IAM refers to a framework or policies and technologies for ensuring that the proper people in an organization have the appropriate access to technology resources.
-> AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service that allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console i.e. create users and grant permissions
   to those users, create groups and roles, control access to AWS resources etc.
-> You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed-in) and authorized (has permission) to use resources.

-> When you first create an AWS account, you create an account identity(or root user), which you use to sign-in to AWS.
-> The 'account root user' credentials are email address used to create the account and a password, which can be used to sign-in to the AWS management console as the root 
   user.
-> When you sign-in as the root user, you have complete, unrestricted access to all resources in your AWS account, including access to your billing information and ability 
   to change the password.
-> This level of access is necessary when you initially set up the account.
-> It is not possible to restrict the permission that are granted to the AWS account root user.  

-> AWS strongly recommends that you do not use the root user for your everyday task, even the administrative ones.
-> Also, AWS recommends that you do not share your root user credentials with anyone, because doing so gives them unrestricted access to your account.
-> Create IAM user for yourself and then assign yourself administrative permission for your account.
-> You can then sign-in as that user to add more users as needed.
-> An IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account root user. 
-> Use other IAM user accounts to manage the administrative task of your account and securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account
   and service management tasks.

Features of IAM
1. Shared access to your AWS account
-> You can grant other people permission to administer and use resources in your AWS account without having to share your access credentials (password or access key).

2. Granular Permissions
-> You can grant different permission to different people for different resources.
-> For instance, you can allow some users complete access to EC2, S3, dynamo DB, Redshift. 
-> While for others, you can allow read only access to just some s3 buckets, or permission to administer just some EC2 instances or to access your billing information but 
   nothing else.

3. Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on Amazon EC2
-> You can use IAM features to securely give applications that run on EC2 instances the credentials that they need in order to access other AWS resources.
-> Example, include S3 buckets and RDS or DynamoDB databases.

4. Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
-> You can add two-factor authentication to your account and to individual users for extra security. 
-> You can use physical hardware or virtual MFA (for eg -> Google Authenticator).    

5. Identity Federation
-> You can allow users who already have passwords elsewhere, for eg. in your corporate network or with an internet identity provider to get temporary access to your AWS 
   account.

6. Identity information for assurance
-> If you use AWS CloudTrail, you receive log records that include information about those who made requests for resources in your account. That information is based on
   IAM identities.

7. PCI-DSS Compliance
-> IAM supports the processing, storage and transmission of credit cards by a merchant or service provider, and has been validated as being Compliant with Payment Card 
   Industries (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS).

8. Eventually Consistent 
-> If a request to change some data is successful, the change is committed and safely stored. 
-> However, the change must be replicated across IAM, which can take some time.
-> IAM achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers within AWS data centers around the world.   

Limitation on User Account
-> IAM user limit is 5000 per AWS account. You can add up to 10 users at one time.
-> You are also limited to 300 Groups per AWS account.
-> You are limited to 1000 IAM roles under an AWS account.
-> Default limits of managed policies attached to an IAM role and IAM user is 10.
-> IAM users can be a member of 10 groups (max.).
-> We can assign two access keys (max.) to an IAM user.

<h3><u>Free to Use</u></h3>
-> AWS IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional charges.
-> You will be charged only for use of other AWS products by your IAM users.
