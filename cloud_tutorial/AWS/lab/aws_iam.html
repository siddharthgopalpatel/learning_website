<h3><u>Lab 2 - How to create IAM User and assign policies =></u></h3>

Note: 
- There are three ways we can put policies/permissions to user - Add user to group, copy permission from existing user and attach existing policies directly.
- You can customize the account alias.
- You can create maximum 10 IAM user at one single shot.

1. Go to IAM -> Go to USER -> Add users(username=test, give suitable access type, console password and Require password reset) -> Permissions -> Attach existing policies 
   directly (ec2readonlyaccess) -> Tags (name=IAM user) -> Review -> Create user.
2. Download the csv file and get all the details. Copy the URL and login as created IAM user -> Create your new password -> Login and explore(ec2, s3, vpc etc).
3. To add additional permission to IAM user -> select it ->  Add permission (AmazonS3FullAccess) -> Review -> Add permission.
4. Check if user can do s3 work or not.

<h3><u>Lab 3 - How to create IAM Group,Inline Policy and Billing Dashboard =></u></h3>

Inline Policy - These policies you create manually like create volume or create image from volume from EC2. It can be applied on user and group.

<h3><u>Lab 4 - Cross Account access using IAM Role =></u></h3>
 
Steps to do:
1. Login into A account. 
2. Create one group and then create two IAM users in it (user1 and user2).

10. Repeat step 8 and 9 with user2.
11. Now login to B account -> Role -> trusted relationship -> edit -> Paste ARN of user1 -> Update Policy.
12. Now login back again in user1 -> Switch role -> test s3 bucket.
