<html><h2><u><center>AWS Global Infrastructure</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>
-> AWS global infrastructure is split between regions and availability zones. At the time of writing, <mark>there's 34 regions and 108 availability zones.</mark> The number of regions
   and availability zones will keep changing, itâ€™s important to understand the difference between regions and availability zones. 

<h3><u>Availability Zones (AZs) -</u></h3>
-> Availability Zones (AZs) consist of one or more physically separated data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.
-> Think of an availability zone as a data center. If you haven't worked in tech before, if you've never been to a data center, you might be wondering what a data center is. 
-> A data center is simply a building that's filled with servers. That's all it is. It's a building with rows and rows of servers. They're all inside data halls and you have 
   multiple data halls per data center depending on the data center architecture.
-> Now, an availability zone may have several different data centers, but because they're close together, they will be counted as one availability zone. So it doesn't 
   necessarily mean it's just one data center. They will be close enough together to be grouped into one availability zone. 

<h3><u>Region -</u></h3>   
-> Region is simply a location. So it could be London, Cape Town, Sydney, Northern Virginia, etc. It's just a physical location. 
-> Each region consists of two or more availability zones. So in this region, we've got three availability zones, we've got availability zone A, availability zone  B, and 
   availability zone C.

<h3><u>How does AWS group Regions?</u></h3> 
-> AWS logically groups its Regions into geographic locations. Regions are fully independent and isolated, what does it mean is if one Region is impacted, the others will 
   not be impacted. Regions are isolated, and resources aren't automatically replicated across them.
-> So if you check <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/">Regions and Availability Zones</a> on AWS page, you can see here, we've got all the different regions inside North America. 
-> You can click on different tabs and see it inside South America, Europe and the Middle East and Asia Pacific etc. So there are regions and availability zones everywhere. 
-> So if we go over to North America, we can scroll down here and we can see that US East (Northern Virginia) Region. So this has six availability zones in it and it was 
  launched in 2006.

<h3><u>Edge Locations</u></h3> 
-> An edge location is basically just endpoints for AWS that are used for caching content. Typically this consists of things like cloudfront, which is Amazon's Content 
   delivery network(CDN), which we're going to learn about a little bit later on in the course. 
-> Essentially all you need to know that there are many more edge locations than there are regions. Currently there are over <mark>215 edge locations</mark> around the world.
