-> Networking connects computers together and allows for the sharing of data and applications, around the globe, in a secure manner using virtual routers, firewalls, and network management services.	
-> Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
   - VPC is a foundational service that allows you to create a secure private network in the AWS cloud where you launch your resources.
   - Private virtual network
   - Launch resources like EC2 instances inside the VPC
   - Isolate and protect resources
   - A VPC spans Availability Zones in a Region
   
-> VPC - A VPC is a private network in the AWS Cloud.
-> Availability Zone - AZ consist of one or more physcially seprated data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity housed in seprate facalities.
-> Subnet - A subnet allows you to split the network inside the VPC. This is where you launch resources like EC2 instances.
-> NACL - Network Access Control List(NACLs) ensure the proper traffic is allowed into the subnet.
-> Router and Router Table - Defines where network traffic is routed.
-> Internet Gateway - An Internet Gateway allows public traffic to the internet from a VPC. 
-> Internet  - Just a internet

-> VPC peering allows you to connect 2 VPCs together. Peering facilitates the transfer of data in a secure manner.
