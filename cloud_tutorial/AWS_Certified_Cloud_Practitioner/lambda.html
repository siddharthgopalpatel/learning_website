<h4><pre>
-> Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without managing servers.
-> You author application code, called functions, using many popular languages.
-> Scales automatically
-> Serverless means you don’t worry about managing servers like with EC2.
-> Lambda allows developers to focus on core business logic for the apps they are developing instead of worrying about managing servers.

-> Use Cases

   4. Lambda functions have a 15-minute timeout.

-> Pricing - You are charged based on the duration and number of requests.
   1. Compute time -> Pay only for compute time used, there is no charge if your code is not running.
