     Lambda - Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without managing servers.
     Fargate - Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers.
     Lightsail - Lightsail allows you to quickly launch all the resources you need for small projects.
	 Outposts - Outposts allows you to run cloud services in your internal data center.
	 Batch - Batch allows you to process large workloads in smaller chunks (or batches).
	 
-> Storage
    Simple Storage Service (S3) - S3 is an object storage service for the cloud that is highly available.
    Elastic Block Store (EBS) - EBS is a storage device (called a volume) that can be attached to (or removed from) your instance.
    Elastic File System (EFS) - EFS is a serverless network file system for sharing files.
    Storage Gateway - Storage Gateway is a hybrid storage service.
	Backup - Backup helps you manage data backups across multiple data services
    EC2 Instance Store - An instance store is local storage that is physically attached to the host computer and cannot be removed.

-> Content Delivery 
   CloudFront - CloudFront is a CDN that delivers data and applications globally with low latency.
   Global Accelerator - Global Accelerator sends your users through the AWS global network when accessing your content, speeding up delivery.
   S3 Transfer Acceleration - S3 Transfer Acceleration improves content uploads and downloads to and from S3 buckets.

-> Networking
   Route 53 - Route 53 is a DNS service that routes users to applications.
   Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - VPC is a foundational service that allows you to create a secure private network in the AWS Cloud where you launch your resources.
   Direct Connect - Direct Connect is a dedicated physical network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS.
   Virtual Private Network (VPN) - Site-to-Site VPN creates a secure connection between your internal networks and your AWS VPCs. 
   API Gateway - API Gateway allows you to build and manage APIs.

-> Databases 
     Relational Database Service (RDS) - RDS is a service that makes it easy to launch and manage relational databases.
     Aurora - Aurora is a relational database compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL that was created by AWS.

-> Migration and Transfer 
     Database Migration Service (DMS) - DMS helps you migrate databases to or within AWS.
     Server Migration Service (SMS) - SMS allows you to migrate on-premises servers to AWS.
     Snow Family - The Snow Family allows you to transfer large amounts of on-premises data to AWS using a physical device.
     DataSync - DataSync allows for online data transfer from on-premises to AWS storage services like S3 or EFS.


-> Analytics
    Redshift - Redshift is a scalable data warehouse solution.
	Athena - Athena is a query service for Amazon S3.
    Glue - Glue prepares your data for analytics.
    Kinesis - Kinesis allows you to analyze data and video streams in real time.
    Elastic MapReduce (EMR) - EMR helps you process large amounts of data.
    Data Pipeline - Data Pipeline helps you move data between compute and storage services running either on AWS or on-premises.

-> Machine Learning 
    Rekognition - Rekognition allows you to automate your image and video analysis.
    Comprehend - Comprehend is a natural-language processing (NLP) service that finds relationships in text.
	Polly - Polly turns text into speech.
    SageMaker - SageMaker helps you build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly.
    Translate - Translate provides language translation.
	Lex - Lex helps you build conversational interfaces like chatbots.

-> Developer Tools 
    Cloud9 - Cloud9 allows you to write code within an integrated development environment (IDE) from within your web browser.  
    CodeCommit - CodeCommit is a source control system for private Git repositories.  
    CodeBuild - CodeBuild allows you to build and test your application source code. 
    CodeDeploy - CodeDeploy manages the deployment of code to compute services in the cloud or on-premises.
    CodePipeline - CodePipeline automates the software release process.
    X-Ray - X-Ray helps you debug production applications.

-> Deployment and Infrastructure Management
    CloudFormation - CloudFormation allows you to provision AWS resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
    Elastic Beanstalk - Elastic Beanstalk allows you to deploy your web applications and web services to AWS. 
    OpsWorks - OpsWorks allows you to use Chef or Puppet to automate the configuration of your servers and deploy code.

-> Messaging and Integration
    Simple Queue Service (SQS) - SQS is a message queuing service that allows you to build loosely coupled systems.
    Simple Notification Service (SNS) - SNS allows you to send emails and text messages from your applications.
    Simple Email Service (SES) - SES is an email service that allows you to send richly formatted HTML emails from your applications.
