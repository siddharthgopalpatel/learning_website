<html><h2><u><center>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</center></u></h2>
<h4><pre>

-> EC2 allows you to rent and manage virtual servers in the cloud. 
-> North Virginia(US-EAST-1) is a region tha falls under the geographic location of US EAST.
-> A single Region contains multiple AZs.
-> A single AZ contains multiple data centers.
-> A single data center contains multiple servers.
-> Servers are the physical compute hardware running in a data center.
-> EC2 instances are the virtual servers running on these physical servers.
-> Instances are not considered serverless.
-> Let's take a closer look, EC2 is a foundational service used for managing your virtual instances.
   1. You're able to provision an EC2 instance at the click of a button.
   2. You can use a preconfigured template called an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to launch your instance.
   3. You can deploy your applications directly to EC2 instances.
   4. You receive 750 compute hours per month on the Free Tier plan.
   
-> Use Cases 
   - EC2 in the Real World, Let's discuss when you would use EC2 in the real world.
     1. Deploy a database - Deploying a database to EC2 gives you full control over the database.
     2. Deploy a web application - Deploy to multiple AZs to make the web application highly available.
	 
-> Connectivity 
   - Methods to Access an EC2 Instance. There are several ways to access your EC2 instances.
     1. AWS Management Console - You're able to configure and manage your instances via a web browser.
     2. Secure Shell (SSH) - SSH allows you to establish a secure connection to your instance from your local laptop. 
     3. EC2 Instance Connect (EIC) - EIC allows you to use IAM policies to control SSH access to your instances, removing the need to manage SSH keys.
     4. AWS Systems Manager - Systems Manager allows you to manage your EC2 instances via a web browser or the AWS CLI.
	 
   - The most common way to connect to Linux EC2 instances is via Secure Shell (SSH).
     1. Generate a key pair - A key pair, which consists of a private key and a public key, proves your identity when connecting to an EC2 instance.
     2. Connect via SSH - User -> SSH Client on Laptop (Uses private key) -> EC2 instance (Uses public key)
	 
-> Pricing - EC2 Pricing Options, There are several pricing options to choose from for your EC2 instances.
   1. On-Demand
      - A fixed price in which you are billed down to the second based on the instance type. There is no contract, and you pay only for what you use.
      - Use On-Demand instances when:
        1. You care about low cost without any upfront payment or long-term commitment.
        2. Your applications have unpredictable workloads that can't be interrupted.
        3. Your applications are under development.
        4. Your workloads will not run longer than a year.
      - Fun facts:
        - You can reserve capacity using On-Demand Capacity Reservations. 
        - The EC2 capacity is held for you whether or not you run the instance.

   2. Spot (Cheapest Option)
     - Spot instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity. Your request is fulfilled only if capacity is available.
     - Use Spot instances when: 
       1. You are not concerned about the start or stop time of your application.
       2. Your workloads can be interrupted.
       3. Your application is only feasible at very low compute prices.
     - Fun facts:
       - You can save up to 90% off On-Demand prices.
       - You pay the spot price that's in effect at the beginning of each hour.

   3. Reserved Instances (RIs)
     - RIs allow you to commit to a specific instance type in a particular Region for 1 or 3 years.
     - Use Reserved Instances when:
       1. Your application has steady state usage, and you can commit to 1 or 3 years
       2. You can pay money upfront in order to receive a discount on On-Demand prices.
       3. Your application requires a capacity reservation.
     - Fun facts:
       1. You can save up to 75% off On-Demand prices.
       2. You are required to sign a contract.
       3. You can reserve capacity in an Availability Zone for any duration.
       4. You can pay All Upfront, Partial Upfront, or No Upfront. All Upfront for the max term earns the highest discount.
       5. Provides convertible types at 54% discount.

     4. Dedicated Hosts
     - Dedicated Hosts allow you to pay for a physical server that is fully dedicated to running your instances.
     - Use Dedicated Hosts when:
       1. You want to bring our own server-bound software license from vendors like Microsoft or Oracle.
       2. You have regulatory or corporate compliance requirements around tenancy model.
     - Fun facts:
       1. You can save up to 70% off On-Demand prices.
       2. You bring your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses.
       3. There is no multi-tenancy, meaning the server is not shared with other customers.
       4. A Dedicated Host is a physical server, whereas a Dedicated Instance runs on the host.

     5. Savings Plans
     - Savings Plan allows you to commit to compute usage (measured per hour) for 1 or 3 years.
     - Use Savings Plans when:
       1. You want to lower your bill across multiple compute services
       2. You want the flexibility to change compute services, instance types, operating stems, or Regions.
     - Fun facts:
       1. You can save up to 72% off On-Demand prices.
       2. You are not making a commitment to a Dedicated Host, just compute usage.
       3. Savings can be shared across various compute services like EC2, Fargate, and Lambda.
       4. This does not provide a capacity reservation.

-> Features
   - EC2 instances offer load balancing and Auto Scaling. 
     1. Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances. 
        - CLASSIC LOAD BALANCERS, APPLICATION LOAD BALANCERS, GATEWAY LOAD BALANCERS, NETWORK LOAD BALANCERS are few examples.
     2. EC2 Auto Scaling adds or replaces EC2 instances automatically across AZs, based on need and changing demand.
        - HORIZONTAL SCALING OR SCALING OUT
        - Auto Scaling reduces the impact of system failures and improves the availability of your applications.
        - Do not confuse horizontal scaling with vertical scaling (or scaling up), which upgrades an EC2 instance by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing server.
