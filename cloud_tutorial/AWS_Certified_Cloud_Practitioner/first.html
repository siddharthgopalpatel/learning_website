<h4><pre>

-> Understanding Cloud Computing
   -> Cloud computing provides on-demand access to resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
   -> In this lesson, we go over cloud computing and its benefits, characteristics of the cloud, and the different cloud computing models.
   -> Servers are very powerful computers that handle your requests.
   -> Data Centers - Cloud providers have server farms where hundreds of thousands of servers are available for your use.

   -> What is cloud computing, exactly? Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
   -> Compute (EC2, Lambda)
   -> Networking (VPC, Direct Connect) 
   -> Storage (S3, EBS)
   -> Analytics (Athena, Redshift)
   -> Development (Cloud9, CodeCommit) 
   -> Security (IAM, Marcie)
   -> Databases (RDS, DynamoDB)

   -> Virtual Machines - Virtualization lets you divide hardware resources on a single physical server into smaller units.
   -> Physical Server -> The smaller units are called virtual machines (VMs)
   -> Virtualization is at the heart of cloud computing.
   -> Usage - Your usage is placed on a meter. You pay only when you access it and only for what you use.
      -> 1. On Demand - No long-term commitments or upfront payments
      -> 2. Pay as You Go - Pay by the hour or the second for only what you use
	  
   -> Exploring the Advantages of Cloud Computing
      -> There are 6 advantages to cloud computing.
         1. Go Global in minutes - You can deploy your applications around the world at the click of a button.
         2. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers - You can focus on building your applications instead of managing hardware.
         3. Benefit from massive economies of scale - Volume discounts are passed on to you, which provides lower pay-as-you-go prices.
         4. Increase speed and agility - The provided services allow you to innovate more quickly and deliver your applications faster.
         5. Stop guessing capacity - Your capacity is matched exactly to your demand.
         6. Trade capital expense for variable expense - You pay for what you use instead of making huge upfront investments. 
	 
   ->  Benefits of cloud computing
       1. High Availability - Highly available systems are designed to operate continuously without failure for a long time. These systems avoid loss of service by reducing or managing failures.
       2. Elasticity - With elasticity, you don't have to plan ahead of time how much capacity you need. You can provision only what you need, and then grow and shrink based on demand.
       3. Agility - The cloud gives you increased agility. All the services you have access to help you innovate faster, giving you speed to market. 
       4. Durability - Durability is all about long-term data protection. This means your data will remain intact without corruption.
	  
   -> CapEx vs. OpEx (CapEX and OpEx have different implications for cost control)
      1. Capital Expenditures (CapEx) - Capital expenditures are upfront purchases toward fixed assets.
      2. Operating expenses (OpEx) - are funds used to run day-to-day operations.
	  
   -> Cloud Computing Models - There are 3 common cloud computing models.
      1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
          Building Blocks - Fundamental building blocks that can be rented.
          Web Hosting - Monthly subscription to have a hosting company serve your website.
		 
      2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
          Used by Developers - Develop software using web-based tools without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
          Storefront Website - Tools provided to build a storefront application that runs on another company’s server.
		 
      3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
          Complete Application - Using a complete application, on demand, that someone offers to users.
          Email Provider - Your personal email that you access through a web browser is SaaS. 	 

   ->  Cloud Deployment Models - There are 3 common cloud deployment models.
       1. Private Cloud  
         i. Also called "on-premises"
         ii. Exists in your internal data center
         iii. Doesn't offer the advantages of cloud computing	  

       2. Public Cloud 
          i. Offered by AWS
          ii. You aren't responsible for the physical hardware
          iii. Provides all the advantages of cloud computing

       3. Hybrid Cloud - A hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private clouds. 	
          i. Sample architecture for a hybrid solution
          ii. Highly sensitive data stored locally
          iii. Web application runs on AWS infrastructure
          iv. AWS provides tools so they talk to each other (AWS Direct Connect)
		  
   -> AWS Global Infrastructure	  
      -> Regions - A Region is a physical location.
      -> How does AWS group Regions? AWS logically groups its Regions into geographic locations. 
	  -> Region Characteristics - Regions have several characteristics.
            - Fully Independent and Isolated - If one Region is impacted, the others will not be.
            - Resource and Service Specific - Regions are isolated, and resources aren't automatically replicated across them.	  
      -> Availability Zones - Availability Zones (AZs) consist of one or more physically separated data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. 	 
      -> Characteristics of AZs 
         - Did you know AZs are connected among themselves in a single Region? 
         - Physically separated
         - Connected through low-latency links
         - Fault tolerant
         - Allows for high availability
      -> Edge Locations - Edge locations cache content for fast delivery to your users. 	 
         - Latency - Latency is the time that passes between a user request and the resulting response
         - Low Latency - Did you know low latency is better than high latency?
		 
   ->  Exploring Your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account
       -> The AWS Management Console
          - The AWS Management Console allows you to access your AWS account and manage applications running in your account from a web browser. 
          - The console has broad usage.
             1. New to Cloud - If you’re just getting started with the cloud.
             2. Non-Technical Roles - If you serve in a non-technical role: business analyst, project manager, and many more. 
             3. Technical Roles - If you serve in a technical role: software engineer, web developer, solutions architect, and many more.	
          - The console makes it easy to search for and find services.
          - Root User - Did you know the root user is created when you initially sign up for your account? Protect root user with multi-factor authentication (MFA).	

       -> AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
          - The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to access your AWS account through a terminal or command window.  	
          - Sometimes new features are available via the CLI before the console.
          - The CLI is mainly used by developers.
          - Programmatic Access - Programmatic access provides access to your AWS resources through an application or a tool like the CLI.
            1. Command Line Interface - The CLI allows you to manage AWS services from a terminal session on your laptop.
            2. Application Code - AWS services can be accessed from application code using SDKs and programmatic calls.
            3. Software Development Kits (SDKs) - SDKs allow you to access AWS services from popular programming languages like Java, Python, C#, and many more.
