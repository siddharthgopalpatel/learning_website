-> Companies today need to collect, store, and analyze the data they've accumulated over the years on a massive scale. 
-> Storage services in the cloud provide a place for companies to store data.
-> S3 is an object storage service for the cloud that is highly available.
-> Objects (or files) are stored in buckets (or directories).
-> Essentially unlimited storage that can hold millions of objects per bucket.
-> Objects can be public or private.
-> You can upload objects via the console, the CLI, or programmatically from within code using SDKs. 
-> You can set security at the bucket level or individual object level using access control lists (ACLs), bucket policies, or access point policies.
-> You can enable versioning to create multiple versions of your file in order to protect against accidental deletion and to use a previous version.
-> You can use S3 access logs to track the access to your buckets and objects. 
-> S3 is a regional service, but bucket names must be globally unique.

-> Data Accessibility
   - Durability and availability are 2 very different aspects of data accessibility.  
     1. Durability
      - Durability is important so your objects are never lost or compromised.
      - Amazon S3 Standard is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9â€™s) of durability.   
     2. Availability
      - Availability is important so you can access your data quickly when you need it.
      - Amazon S3 Standard is designed for 99.99% availability. 	

-> S3 Storage Class
   -> Amazon S3 offers several storage classes designed for different use cases.
      1. S3 Standard
         - General-purpose storage
         - Data stored across multiple Availability Zones
         - Low latency and high throughput
         - Durability of 99 999999999%
         - Availability of 99.99%
         - Recommended for:
           - Frequently accessed data 


	  2. S3 Intellent-Tiering
         - Automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective storage class
         - Automatic cost savings
         - No retrieval fees
         - Data stored across multiple Availability Zones
         - Durability of 99.999999999%
         - Availability of 99.9%
         - Recommended for:
           - Data with unknown or changing access pattern

      3. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access(IA)
         - Data accessed less frequently but requires rapid access
         - Data stored across multiple Availability Zones
         - Cheaper than S3 Standard.
         - Durability of 99 999999999%
         - Availability of 99.9%
         - Recommended for:
           - Long-lived data
           - Infrequently accessed
           - Millisecond access when needed

      4. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access(IA)
         - Like S3 Standard-IA but data stored in a single Availability Zone
         - Costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA
         - Data stored in this storage class can be lost
         - Durability of 99.999999999%
         - Availability of 99.5%
         - Availability and durability not essential
         - Recommended for:
           - Re-creatable data
           - Infrequently accessed with millisecond access

      5. S3 Glacier
         - Long-term data storage and archival for lower costs
         - Data retrieval takes longer
         - 3 retrieval options: 1-5 minutes, 3-5 hours, or 5-12 hours
         - Data stored across multiple Availability Zones
         - Recommended for:
           - Long-term backups
           - Cheaper storage options   
 
      6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
         - Like S3 Glacier but longer access times
         - 2 retrieval options: 12 hours or 48 hours
         - Cheapest of all S3 options
         - Data stored across multiple Availability Zones
         - Durability of 99.999999999%
         - Recommended for:
           - Long-term data archival accessed once or twice a year
           - Retaining data for regulatory compliance requirements

      7. S3 Outposts
         - Provides object storage on-premises
         - A single storage class
         - Store data across multiple devices and servers
         - Recommended for
           - Data that needs to be kept local
           - Demanding application performance needs
		   
-> S3 in the Real World. Let's discuss when you would use S3 in the real world.
   1. Static websites - Deploy static websites to S3 and use CloudFront for global distribution.
   2. Data Archive - Archive data using Amazon Glacier as a storage option for Amazon S3.
   3. Analytics systems - Store data in Amazon S3 for use with analytics services like Redshift and Athena.
   4. Mobile Applications - Mobile application users can upload files to an Amazon S3 bucket.
