-> Understanding AWS Pricing
   - Pricing = There are 3 fundamental drivers of cost
     1. Compute = Hourly from launch to termination
     2. Storage = The data you store in the cloud
     3. Outbound data transfer = Data in flight moving between systems
	 
   - Free Offer Types = There are 3 different types of free offers available depending on the service you choose.
     1. 12 months free = 12 months' free usage following your initial sign-up date to AWS
     2. Always free = Offers do not expire and are available to all AWS customers
     3. Trials = Short-term free trials starting from the date you activate a particular service
	 
   - AWS Services are priced independently.
     1. EC2 Pricing = Don't forget, there are 5 ways to pay for Amazon EC2 instances.
         On-Demand = You pay by the hour or by the second without pre-paying
         Saving Plan = Commit to compute usage mesaured for a 1 year to 3 year term
         Reserved Instances = Commit to use for 1 or 3 years; pay regardless of usage
         Spot Instances = Instances only launch if spare capacity is available
         Dedicated Hosts = An entire physical server just for you	
    - Don't forget we covered EC2 pricing in more detail in the Exploring Compute Services: EC2 lesson.		

   - Lambda Pricing	= Don't forget how you're charged when using Lambda.
     1. Number of requests = Includes test invokes from the console
     2. Code execution time = From execution start, in response to events, to stop
     3. Always free = 1 million requests per month
   - Don't forget we covered Lambda pricing in more detail in the Exploring Compute Services: Lambda lesson.
	
   - S3 Pricing = Don't forget with S3, you pay for the storage you use.
      1. Storage Class = Various storage class
      2. Storage = Number and size of objects
      3. Data Transfer = Data trasnferred out of s3 region
      4. Request and data retrival = requests made for data and amount of requests 
    - Don't forget we covered S3 storage classes in more detail in the Leveraging Storage Services lesson.	  
	
   - RDS Pricing = Let's discuss the RDS features that drive pricing.
      1. Running clock hours 
      2. Type of database 
      3. Storage
      4. Purchase type 
      5. Database count 
      6. API requests 
      7. Deployment type 
      8. Data trasnfer
    - Don't forget we discussed RDS in the Utilizing Databases section.

    - Have you heard of the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)?
      - TCO is a financial estimate that helps you understand both the direct and indirect costs of AWS.
      - How much does it cost to migrate to the AWS Cloud?
      - How can I reduce my Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) using AWS?
