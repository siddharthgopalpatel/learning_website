<p><h4>Sometimes we have to use someone else's code in our program because it saves us a lot of time. Today, we will learn a technique to use code that is not written by us but it will enhance the quality of our program, save us time, and of course, it is legal and free.</h4></p>

<pre><h3>Let us understand what utilities like modules and pip are - 

<u>Module</u> – Module or library is a file that contains definitions of several functions, classes, variables, etc. which is written by someone else for us 
to use.

<u>Pip</u> – Pip is a package manager for Python i.e., pip command can be used to download any external module in Python. It is something that helps us to get
code written by someone else from somewhere. 

We can install a module in our system by using pip command: 
•	pip install module_name 

There are two types of modules in Python: 
•	Built-in Modules:
Built-in modules are the modules that are pre-installed in Python i.e.; there is no need to download them before using. These modules come with python interpreter itself.
Example – random, os, etc.

To get a complete list of built-in modules of python head to the following page of the official documentation - https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html.
•	External Modules:

These are the modules that are not pre-installed in Python i.e., we need to download them before using them in our program.
Example – Flask, Pandas, TensorFlow, etc. </h3></pre> </html>
