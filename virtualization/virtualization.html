<html><h1><u><center>Virtualization</center></u></h1>
<h4><pre>
-> Virtualization is the creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something. Such as server, a desktop, a storage device, an operating system or network 
   resources.
-> In other words,  <mark>Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share a single physical instance of a resource or an application among mulitple customers and organization</mark>. 
   It does by assigning a logical name to a physical server and providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.
-> In wikipedia, you can find the definition as - "In computing, virtualization is a broad term that refers to the abstraction of computer resources. It helps us to install 
   different operating systems on a hardware. They are completely separated and independent from each other.
-> Virtualization hides the physical characteristics of computing resources from their users, their application or end users.
-> This includes making a single physical resource (such as a server, an operating system, an application or a storage device) appear to function as multiple virtual 
   resources.
-> It can also include making multiple physical resources (such as storage devices or servers) appear as a single virtual resource.
-> Virtualization is often - 
   a. The creation of many virtual resources from one physical resource.
   <mark>b. The creation of one virtual resource from one or more physical resource.</mark>

<h3><u>Types of Virtualization -</u></h3>
-> Today the term virtualization is widely applied to a number of resources, some are described below -

<u>a. Server Virtualization:-</u> It is virtualizing your server infrastructure where you do not have to use any more physical server for different purpose.

<u>b . Client & Desktop Virtualization:-</u> This is similar to server virtualization, but this time is on the user's side where you virtualize their desktops.
                                      We can change their desktops with thin clients and by utilizing the datacenter resources.

<u>c. Services and Applications Virtualization:-</u> This virtualization technology isolates applications from the underlying operating system and from other applicatons, in order 
                                              to increase compatibility and managebility. 

<u>d. Network Virtualization:-</u> It is a part of virtualization infrastructure, which is used especially if you are going to visualize your servers.
                            It helps you in creating multiple switching, Vlans, NAT-ing, etc.

<u>e. Storage Virtualization:-</u> This is widely used in datacenters where you have a big storage and it helps you to create, delete, allocate storage to different hardware. This 
                            allocation is done through network connection.

<h3><u>What is the need of Virtualization?</u></h3>

-> Let's go through a data center setup of a software company which costs heavily per year, which includes and need below mentioned setup.

1) 2000 sqft area of Datacenter -> capex
2) 100 Physical Server (4GB RAM, 2 core CPU, 100GB HDD). 30 Server utilized for infrastructure(routers, switches, firewall, LB etc.)  and 70 for application. -> capex 
3) Colling System for 100 servers  -> capex & opex
4) 100 Physical disk for server -> capex
5) Cabling for 100 servers and power whips -> capex
6) Data Center staff -> opex
7) Electricity & Power Backup -> opex

<u>Let's see the scenario after Virtualization</u>

Assuming, we're running one application per vm. For example, one dedicated for web server, one for DB server etc.

<img src="pic/virtualization1.JPG" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:600px;height:400px;">

Here, if you are running 10 VM on one physical server, then it means you need only 10 physical server now to host 100 VM servers.

It would be easy to maintain the server, cost-effective for the company if they use Virtualization.
