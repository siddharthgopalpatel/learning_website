<html><u><center><h2>Display server statistics</h2></center></u>
<h4><pre>
-> You can use the Apache’s mod_status module to display a web page containing statistics about the web server’s current state. 
-> Some of the information included in the report are:
   - active connections.
   - the number of worker serving requests.
   - the number of idle worker.
   - the status of each worker, the number of requests that worker has performed and the total number of bytes served by the worker.
   - the total number of accesses and byte count served.
   - the time the server was started/restarted and the time it has been running for.
-> The mod_status module is usually enabled by default. 
-> If not, enable it using the sudo a2enmod status command.
-> To enable access to the server status page, you need to add a Location directive entry within the VirtualHost section in the /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf file.
	&lt;Location "/server-status"&gt;
	SetHandler server-status
	Require ip 192.168
	&lt;/Location&gt;
-> The Location directive listed above specifies that the server statistics page will be displayed when you browse to the /server-status URL. 
-> The Require directive specifies the hosts that will be allowed to access the webpage (in this case, all hosts from the 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255) range.
-> We can get the information by browsing to http://URL/server-status
