<h3>Configure Apache as a forward proxy</h3>
-> Apache can be configured as both a forward and a reverse proxy. 
-> An ordinary proxy (also called a forward proxy) is an intermediate server that sits between the client and the origin server. 
-> The client is configured to use the forward proxy to access other sites. 
-> When a client want to get the content from the origin server, it sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server as the target. 
-> The proxy then requests the content from the origin server and returns it to the client.

<h3>Configure Apache as a Reverse Proxy</h3>
-> Apache can also be configured to serve as a reverse proxy. 
-> A reverse proxy appears to the client just like an ordinary web server and no special configuration on the client is necessary. 
-> The client makes ordinary requests for content. 
-> The reverse proxy then decides where to send those requests and returns the content as if it were itself the origin. 
-> Reverse proxies are usually used to provide Internet users access to a server that is behind a firewall or to balance load among several back-end servers.
-> Here is how we can configure Apache as a reverse proxy:
-> First, we need to enable the proxy, proxy_http, and proxy_connect modules. 
-> We can do that using the a2enmod command:
   a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_connect
-> Next, go to the /etc/apache2/mods-enabled directory and open the file proxy.conf in a text editor of your choice. 
-> Uncomment the ProxyRequests On line, the &lt;Proxy *&gt; block, and the ProxyVia Off line. Change the ProxyRequests to Off and ProxyVia to On.
-> Now, create a new file in the /etc/apache2/sites-available directory. We will call our file reverse_proxy.conf. 
-> This is the configuration of the file:
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
     ServerName msn.local
     ProxyPass / http://www.msn.com
  &lt;Proxy "*"&gt;
     Require ip 192.168
  &lt;/Proxy&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
-> Enable the website using the sudo a2ensite reverse_proxy.conf command and restart Apache. 
-> When the internal client requests the website msn.local, he or she will be redirected to www.msn.com, as specified by the ProxyPass directive.
