<html><u><center><h2>SSL Certificate and How Can It Benefit the Business</h2></center></u>
<h4><pre>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
-> SSL is an acronym for Secure Sockets Layer. 
-> In a nutshell, SSL protocol ensures data security during the transfer of packets between the computer and the web server. 
-> In fact, the name SSL is used colloquially – in most cases, SSL protocol is replaced by a newer and more advanced TLS certificate (the acronym for Transport Layer Security). 
-> An SSL certificate is a type of security protocol that helps keep your website safe and secure for your visitors. 
-> It creates a secure connection between the user’s browser and your website, which helps to protect their information. 
-> An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to establish a secure connection between a web server and a web browser. 
-> SSL certificates are used to encrypt traffic between the two systems, which helps to protect sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and login credentials, from being intercepted by third parties. 
-> So, in short, an SSL certificate – It’s a security protocol that helps to keep your website safe and secure for your visitors. 
-> It is recommended that all businesses, regardless of size, have an SSL certificate installed on their website. 

<h3>How do I know if a connection is encrypted?</h3>
-> In the simplest possible way: if the website contains HTTPS web address and looks similar to this URL: https://google.com (this is just an example), the website has the SSL certificate implemented. 
-> If there is no SSL certificate or it is incorrectly connected, a message will appear that the website is not secured. Always look at the website’s address. 
-> The page that poses a risk to internet users will not be displayed to them. Instead, you can see a warning message informing about the nature of the problem: 
-> When browser connects to a website with an SSL certificate implemented, the browser verifies the validity of the certificate used by the website. 
-> If it does not pass the authentication process (for various reasons), Firefox will terminate the connection with the website and display the error message “Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead”. 

<h3>Types of SSL certificates</h3>
-> Domain-validated SSL certificates are the most basic type of certificate and are usually the quickest and easiest to obtain. 
-> With a DV certificate, the issuing authority will only verify that you own the domain name.

-> Organization-validated SSL certificates offer more security than DV certificates, as the issuing authority will also verify your organization’s identity. 
-> This process usually takes a little longer than DV, but it provides your visitors with more confidence in your website.

-> Extended Validation SSL certificates offer the highest level of security and are usually only available for larger businesses. 
-> With an EV certificate, the issuing authority will verify your organization’s identity, as well as the domain ownership. 
-> This process can take up to a few weeks, but it provides your visitors with the highest level of confidence in your website.

<h3>How can an SSL certificate benefit your business? </h3>
-> As a business, you want to always provide the best possible experience for your customers and website visitors. 
-> This can be done in many different ways and an SSL certificate is one way to show your commitment to security and customer satisfaction.

<u>Boosts your website’s search engine ranking</u>
-> Your website is the basis of your business. It’s how you connect with your customers and market your products or services. 
-> So, it’s important to make sure that your website is secure and accessible to everyone. 
-> The way this works is that Google and other search engines will give preference to websites that have SSL certificates over those that don’t. 
-> This is because these websites are seen as more trustworthy and secure, which helps to improve the user experience.

<u>Builds trust and confidence with your visitors</u>
-> An SSL certificate can benefit your business in many ways. 
-> It helps to keep your website safe and secure, which can boost your search engine ranking and build trust with your visitors. 
-> It also helps to protect customers’ information from being intercepted by third parties. 
-> If you are looking to improve the security of your website, an SSL certificate is a great place to start. 
-> This is because it is a simple and effective way to show your commitment to security and customer satisfaction.


<u>Can increase the visibility of your website</u>
-> An SSL certificate can also help to increase the visibility of your website. 
-> When a website is secured with SSL, it will display a green padlock in the address bar of the browser. 
-> This helps to show visitors that your website is safe and secure, which can encourage them to stay on your site longer and visit more pages. 
-> Because your website is more visible, it can also attract more visitors from search engines. 
-> This automatically leads to an increase in traffic and can ultimately help to boost your bottom line.

<h3>Generate SSL/TLS Certificates</h3>
-> There are multiple options to choose from when you want to secure Apache with SSL/TLS certificates.
   - You can use self-signed certificates for test purposes.
   - You can order for a commercially trusted server certificate from your preferred CA
   - You can use the free, automated, and open CA, Let’s Encrypt.
-> Well, in this guide, we are using the first option of self-signed SSL/TLS certificates for demonstration purposes.
-> Openssl command is used to generate the SSL/TLS certificates as shown below;
   - openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/kifar.key -x509 -days 365 -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/kifar.crt
       req: It is used to create CSR as well as the self signed certificates.
       -newkey rsa:4096: This option creates a new certificate request and a 4096 bits RSA key at the same time.
       -nodes: When this option is specified then if a private key is created it will not be encrypted.
       -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/kifarunix-demo.key: Writes the newly created private key to the specified filename. 
       -x509: This option outputs a self signed certificate instead of a certificate request.
       -days 365: Used to specify the validity period for the self signed certificate generated. This therefore is valid for 365 days.
       -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/kifarunix-demo.crt: Specifies the output filename to write the self signed certificate to.
-> When the command runs, you are prompted to provide certificate identification details such the Country Name of your organization, the State, the Locality, the name of Organization, the Organization Unit, 
   the Common Name (This is the most important detail), optional email.
-> You can as well be able to provide these details on the command line using the -subj option of the openssl-req command as shown below;
   -subj "/C=CN/ST=STATE/L=CITY/O=ORG NAME/OU=Department/CN=DOMAIN_NAME/emailAddress=name@domain"
-> For example to generate a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate for the domain, kifarunix-demo.com and all its sub-domains (Common name will be written as *.kifarunix-demo.com), you can use openssl-req command as; (Replace the domain names accordingly)
     openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/kifarunix-demo.key -x509 -days 365 -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/kifarunix-demo.crt \
     -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Springfield/O=kifarunix-demo/OU=IT/CN=*.kifarunix-demo.com/emailAddress=admin@kifarunix-demo.com"
-> Well, there you go. Your private key has been written to /etc/pki/tls/private/kifarunix-demo.key while your certificate has been written to /etc/pki/tls/certs/kifarunix-demo.crt.
-> Well, want to use commercially signed certificates? Generate the CSR and submit it to your favourite CA to order for trusted certificates.
-> The command below can get you a CSR. Make due substitution.
     openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout domain.key -out domain.csr \
     -subj "/C=CN/ST=STATE/L=CITY/O=ORG NAME/OU=Department/CN=DOMAIN_NAME/emailAddress=name@domain"
-> Be sure to keep the key safe as you will need when installing the certificates.


<h3>Implement SSL</h3>
-> To encrypt communication between your Apache web server and web clients, you need to use the mod_ssl module. 
-> Enable this module using the sudo a2enmod ssl command.
-> The default SSL configuration file is /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf. 
-> The default SSL configuration will use a certificate and key generated by the ssl-cert package. 
-> The default certificate and keys can be used for testing purposes, but it is recommened that you replace them with a certificate and keys specific to the site or server.
-> The default-ssl.conf file has the same entries as the default site file (000-default.conf), but it adds directives for SSL. 
-> By default, the SSL virtual host will use the port 443.
-> To configure Apache for HTTPS, use the sudo a2ensite default-ssl command.
-> The default certificate is /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem, and the default key is /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key.
-> Restart Apache in order for the changes to take effect (sudo service apache2 restart). Now you can access your website using HTTPS.
-> The default document root is /var/www/html. You will probably get the certificate error page, but you can accept the certificate to view the webpage.

<h3>Check SSL Certificate Expiry Date from Certificate File</h3>
-> Well, there are various ways in which you can monitor SSL/TLS certificate expiration date. For example, you can;
   - Monitor SSL/TLS Certificate Expiry with Prometheus and Grafana
   - Monitor SSL/TLS Certificates Expiry with Nagios
   - However, there are some instances when maybe you just have the SSL/TLS certificate file and you want to find out the expiration date. 
     This is where openssl command comes in handy.
-> openssl is a general-purpose SSL/TLS cryptographic command line tool that can be used to perform cryptographic operations such as:
   - creating RSA, DH, and DSA key parameters
   - creating X.509 certificates, CSRs, and CRLs
   - calculating message digests
   - encrypting and decrypting with ciphers
   - testing SSL/TLS clients and servers
   - handling S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
   - and even checking the expiration dates of the SSL/TLS certificate files
-> SSL/TLS certificates uses X.509 digital certificates standard. 
-> Thus, if you want to use openssl command to check SSL certificate expiry date from the certificate file, you need to pass the x509 options (openssl x509 [options])
-> You can pass other options that enables you to view the status of the certificate file. To get the options, check the help information (openssl x509 -help)
-> So our options of interest in checking SSL expiry date from the certificate file is;
   -enddate: which shows expiry date of the certificate
   -in infile: specify the file you want to check.
-> So, for example, let’s assume we have an SSL cerificate file, kifarunix.com.crt, then you can check expiry date by running;
   openssl x509 -enddate -in kifarunix.com.crt
-> You can also pass the -noout option to suppresses the output of the command and just print the expiry date.
   openssl x509 -enddate -in kifarunix.com.crt -noout
-> Well, you can also connect to the site and check SSL expiry directly from the command line -
   openssl s_client -connect kifarunix.com:443 -showcerts | openssl x509 -enddate -noout
openssl x509 -dates -subject -noout -alias -issuer -in server.crt
openssl x509 -text -in server.crt

-> When it comes to SSL/TLS certificate files, most commonly, they are in PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) format, represented as ASCII text with common file extensions such as .pem, .crt, .cer, or .key file extension.
