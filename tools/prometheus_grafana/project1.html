<html><u><center><h2>Project - 1 (Linux Monitoring system)</h2></center></u>
<h4><pre>

-> Our Linux monitoring system consists of 3 components — Prometheus, Exporter & Grafana. We will use this system to monitor our Linux server metrics.

<h3>What will we monitor?</h3>
-> Using this system, we’ll monitor our Linux server metrics such as CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, etc. 
-> These metrics will be displayed on a Grafana dashboard. 
-> This dashboard can be set to refresh automatically after a fixed time.

<h3>Steps to be followed</h3>
1. Access the prometheus web using IP:9090, 
   The scraped metrics can be viewed under - http://IP:9090/metrics
   To check the status of your node, navigate to Status > Targets. (prometheus, node_exporter target should be up)
   To view the metrics from Prometheus Web interface, and enter any expression for a specific metric you want to see. For example, to check the target’s available memory, you would just type, node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes and click execute. 
   Ensure that the times in both Prometheus server and target are synchronized. To see the Graphical view, click on the Graph tab.

2. Access Node Exporter on http://IP:9100. You should be able to see the collected metrics by executing curl http://IP:9100/metrics
   To check for the system metrics, you can grep for the metrics prefixed with node_. For example;
   curl http://IP:9100/metrics | grep node_ | grep filesystem

3. Grafana container is not starting the grafana service by default on bootup. Need to execute the below command -
   docker exec -it grafana service grafana-server status
   docker exec -it grafana service grafana-server start
   
   Access the grafana web using IP:3000

4. Configure Grafana.
   Add Prometheus data source in Grafana. Go to http://localhost:3000/datasources and click the Add data source button.

5. Load Linux metrics dashboard.
   To import it, go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard/import & enter (1860, 159, 3662, 10204, 10180) in the text box. Click the Load button. Choose Prometheus data store & click Import.
