<h4><pre>
1. Lean startup thinking
   -> The lean startup cycle 
      - Focuses on identifying the viability of ideas
      - Follows the plan-do-check-adjust cycle (PDCA)
   -> Minimum viable product (MVP) 
      - Delivers just enough functionality to test assumptions
      - Clearly defines desired outcomes
   -> Hypothesis evaluation
      — If true, implement more features
      — If false, pivot to a new hypothesis or stop work on the Epic  
	  
2. Innovation accounting
   -> Measuring new products and new features is difficult when using traditional accounting standards
   -> Use Metrics that will validate its success or failure when defining an MVP 
   -> Focus on Metrics that demonstrate real Customer engagement and not on vanity Metrics
   -> Look for leading indicators: Actionable Metrics that measure early results and are good predictors of future business outcomes
