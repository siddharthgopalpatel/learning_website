1. Chaos engineering
   -> Step 1: Read the blog post in your workbook.
   -> Step 2: Discuss as a team:
      — How did Netflix prepare for the AWS outage? 
      — Would your systems be prepared for a similar event? 
      — How might your organization apply chaos engineering? 

2. Proactive detection
   -> Decoupling deployment from release allows problem detection before problems are exposed to Customers
   -> Proactively looking for problems and practice disaster recovery (DR) procedures
   -> Coordinating DR simulation events with failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) during architecture and design

3. Cross-team collaboration
   -> Responding to production failures is a cross-functional responsibility
   -> Developers should be able to support their own code in production
   -> Teams across the Value Stream should work together to detect, resolve, and learn from production incidents

4. Immutable infrastructure
   -> Prohibits changes from being made directly on production systems
   -> Forces all changes to be deployed through the Continuous Delivery Pipeline
   -> Minimizes configuration drift between production and non-production environments

5. Session replay
   -> Records Customer sessions and replays them on demand
   -> Aids in reproducing, analyzing, and fixing production issues
   -> Can be performed in production, testing, and development environments
   -> Requires careful attention to data security, privacy, and retention policies

6. Rollback and fix forward
   -> Rolling back removes production issues by restoring the production environment to a previous, stable state
   -> Fixing forward resolves production issues by deploying ‘fixes’ to the production environment
   -> Each must be done quickly to minimize service disruption and mean time to restore (MTTR) 
   -> Each is performed via the pipeline, not directly against production systems
