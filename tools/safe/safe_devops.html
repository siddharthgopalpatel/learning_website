-> What is DevOps?
   - DevOps is a mindset, a culture, and a set of technical practices.
   - It provides communication, integration, automation, and close cooperation among all the people needed to plan, develop, test, deploy, release, and maintain a Solution.
   
-> SAFe helps bridge the gap between Agile and DevOps
   - SAFe® 5 for Lean Enterprises is a knowledge base of proven, integrated principles, practices, and competencies for achieving Business Agility by implementing Lean, Agile, and DevOps at scale.

-> The Continuous Delivery Pipeline (CDP) accelerates value flow 
-> It consists of - 
   - Continuous Exploration
   - Continuous Integration
   - Continuous Deployment
   - Release On Demand
   
-> The DevOps Health Radar is a more detailed view of the CDP
-> It consists of 4 aspects - 
   • Continuous Exploration
   • Continuous Integration
   • Continuous Deployment
   • Release on Demand
-> It consists of 16 activities 
   - Hypothesize
   - Collaborate & Research
   - Architect
   - Synthesize
   - Develop
   - Build
   - Test-End to End
   - Stage
   - Deploy
   - Verify
   - Monitor
   - Respond
   - Release
   - Stablize
   - Measure
   - Learn
   
-> The role of continuous security
   - Security is a key concept in DevOps and should be part of every DevOps transformation 
   - DevSecOps concepts present key principles for value delivery
   - Security affects every aspect of the continuous delivery cycle
   - Threat Modeling(Architect), Application Security(Build), Penetration Testing(Verify), Continuous Security Monitoring(Stablize)
   
-> The role of continuous testing
   - Build quality into Solutions by testing early and often
   - Include automated testing and quality assurance in every DevOps transformation
   - Behavior-driven Development(Synthesize), Test-driven Deployment(Develop), Test Automation(Build, Test-End to End), Production Testing(Verify), Continuous Monitoring(Stablize)

-> A CALMR approach to DevOps
   - C (Culture - Culture of shared responsibility) = Establish a culture of shared responsibility for development, deployment, and operations.
     ► Adopt a culture of shared responsibility for development and deployment 
     ► Tolerate failure and rapid recovery
     ► Share discoveries, practices, tools, and learning across silos
	 
   - A (Automation - Automation of Continuous Delivery Pipeline) = Automate the Continuous Delivery Pipeline.
     ► Manual steps reduce quality and result in slow delivery. 
     ► Automate as much of the CDP as possible with an integrated toolchain. 
     ► Automate healthy processes. If the underlying process is broken, fix it before automating it.

   - L (Lean flow - Lean Flow accelerates delivery) - Keep batch sizes small, limit WIP, and provide extreme visibility.
     ► Identify bottlenecks to the flow of value
     ► Decrease the batch sizes of the work
     ► Manage and reduce queue lengths  
 
   - M (Measurement - Measurement of flow, quality & value) - Measure the flow through the pipeline. Implement full-stack telemetry.
     ► Collect data on business, application, infrastructure, and client layers
     ► Collect data about the deployment pipeline
     ► Maintain different telemetry for different stakeholders
     ► Broadcast measurements
     ► Continuously improve telemetry during and after problem solving

   - R (Recovery - Recovery reduces risk & preserves value) - Architect and enable low-risk releases. Establish fast recovery, fast reversion, and fast fix-forward
     ► Adopt a stop-the-line mentality
     ► Plan for failures and rehearse failures
     ► Build the environment for roll-back and fix-forward

-> What is a development value stream?
   - Development value streams contain all the activities, people, systems, information, and material necessary to deliver value.
   
-> Why map your development value stream?
   ► Understand how work flows through the organization from concept to cash
   ► Measure process quality and organizational efficiency
   ► Identify bottlenecks to the flow of value
   ► Understand how we can improve the flow of value

-> DevOps Transformation Canvas
   - Value Stream
   - Demand Rate
   - Trigger
   - First Step
   - Last Step
   - Current State Metrics
     - Total Process Time (some of all individual PT values)
     - Total Lead Time (sum of all individual LT values)
     - Activity Ratio (total process time divided by total lead time)
     - Rolled % Complete & Accurate
   - Future State Metrics
     - Total Process Time (some of all individual PT values)
     - Total Lead Time (sum of all individual LT values)
     - Activity Ratio (total process time divided by total lead time)
     - Rolled % Complete & Accurate
   - Boundaries and Limitations
   - Improvement items
   
-> Measure each step
   - Process Time (PT) - Actual value-added work
   - Lead Time (LT) - Time from ‘ready for next step’ to ‘step complete.’ 
   - Percent Complete and accurate (%C&A) - Percent of work that the next step can process as-is. 
   - Activity Ratio: PT/LT
   - Rolled %C&A: (%C&A 1) * (%C&A 2) * (%C&A n) * 100
