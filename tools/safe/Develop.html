1. Break Features into Stories
   - Common Patterns
     - Workflow steps
     - Business rule variations
     - Major effort
     - Simple/complex
     - Variations in data
     - Data methods
     - Defer system qualities
     - Operations
     - Use-case scenarios
     - Break out a spike
	 
2. Test-driven development (TDD)
3. Version control
   -  Maintain all Solution assets (requirements, code, infrastructure configurations, tests, test data, and policies) under version control
   -  Establish clear check-in and check-out procedures
   -  Use version control to improve traceability for automating compliance
   
4. Agile software engineering
   - Agile software engineering practices boost speed and quality
     - Test-first mindset
     – Agile modeling  
     – Emergent design
     – Pattern-based coding
     – Code reviews

5. Pair work
   - Improves system quality, design decisions, knowledge sharing, and team velocity
   - Is a collaborative effort between any two individuals
   - Is broader and less constraining than pair programming
   - Can be spontaneous, scheduled, or performed on rotation
   
6. Application telemetry
   - Collects runtime data about user-facing parts of the Solution 
   - Enables faster identification of production issues
   - Captures information that will be used to evaluate the hypothesis
   - Must be built in at development time and trace to leading and lagging indicators
