<h4><pre>
1. SRE
   -> Ensure large systems are highly reliable and scalable:
      - Shared ownership of system stability between Dev and Ops
      - T-shaped engineers with development and operations expertise
      - Approaching all operational activities as a software concern
      - Closely managing Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
	  
2. Failover/disaster recovery
   -> Failures will occur. Develop the ability to recover quickly.
   -> Disaster recovery must be planned, architected, and practiced
   -> Failover allows for continuous availability of service

3. Continuous security monitoring
   -> Detect intrusions and attacks on production services and infrastructure (detective controls). 
   -> Use preventive controls, such as security as code and penetration testing, to focus on preventing known vulnerabilities from getting to production. 
   -> Test services continuously for newly discovered and reported vulnerabilities.
