<h4><pre>
1. Feature writing
   -> Include a benefit hypothesis to justify implementation costs and to provide the business perspective needed when making scope decisions.
   -> Define acceptance criteria to identify the requirements that must be met for the Feature to be complete. 
   -> Include functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements.
   -> Be sure that the Feature fits in one Program Increment

2. Behavior-driven development
   -> BDD is a test-first approach to writing requirements
   -> Acceptance criteria are written in the following structure
      - Given [a specific initial condition] 
      - When [a specific action occurs]
      - Then [a specific result is expected]
   -> BDD permits building executable specifications
   -> Acceptance criteria become acceptance tests 

3. Economic prioritization
   -> In the Continuous Delivery Pipeline, job sequencing is the key to economic outcomes.
   -> Give preference to jobs with shorter duration and higher cost of delay using weighted shortest job first (WSJF)
   -> WSJF:
      - Provides a way of understanding the cost of delay
      - Focused on items that provide the best cost of delay reduction in the shortest time
   -> WSJF = Cost of delay
             -------------
             Job duration
              (Job size)

4. PI Planning
   -> PI Planning is an event that aligns all teams on the Agile Release Train (ART) to a shared mission and Vision.
