<h4><pre>
1. Continuous code integration

2. Build and test automation
   - Build often, preferably on every commit
   - Run unit tests as part of the build
   - Run static code analysis as part of the build
   - Visualize and monitor the build and test process
   - Report failures immediately
   - Address broken builds as the highest priority

3. Trunk-based development
   - Manage one trunk for all teams
   - Merge every commit to main
   - Avoid long-lived and multiple open branches   
   
4. Gated commit
   - Ensures that broken code doesnâ€™t block the developers or the pipeline
   - Commits only changes that have passed all build and quality checks to the repository
   - Sends immediate feedback when code has been rejected
   
5. Application security 
   - Apply tools to automatically identify security vulnerabilities in the code during the build process
   - Assess open source libraries continuously for known vulnerabilities to identify risks during development or build processes
