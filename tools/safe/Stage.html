<h4><pre>
1. Maintain a staging environment
   -> Maintain a staging environment to prepare for moving to production
   -> Deploy to staging at least every Iteration and run your System Demos from there
   -> Ideally, deploy to staging automatically after all builds and end-to-end tests have passed 
   
2. Blue/green deployment
   -> Maintain two identical environments: idle and live.
   -> New features are deployed to the idle environment on a continuous basis. While staged, the features can be tested and showcased in preparation for release.
   -> New code is released to the idle environment where it is thoroughly tested. When the code is ready to be released, the team makes the idle environment live.
   -> If problems are discovered after the switch, the active environment is switched back to idle, restoring the previously active environment.
   -> Switching between environments is typically done by redirecting traffic at the load balancer.
   
3. System Demo
   -> Demo working, integrated systems every two weeks
   -> Show new features working together and with existing functionality
   -> Demo from a staging environment that resembles production
   -> Receive feedback from program stakeholders
