<h4><pre>
1. Congruence between test and production environments
   -> Ensure test environments match production as much as possible
   -> Maintain all configuration changes under version control
   -> Invest in production-grade systems and data for more accurate testing
   -> Reduce complexity and cost with service virtualization
   
2. Test automation
   -> Functional testing
   -> Integration testing
   -> Regression testing
   -> Performance testing
   -> Security testing
   -> Penetration testing
   -> Exploratory tests are not automated
   
3. Test data management
   -> Use production-grade data for all types of tests
   -> Synchronize data frequently between production and test environments
   -> Store test data in version control
   -> Carefully manage data privacy and security
   
4. Service virtualization
   -> Test environments that mimic production systems
   -> System behavior is recorded and played back
   -> Configurations are maintained in version control
   
5. NFRs
   -> NFRs are system qualities that support end-user functionality and system goals.
   -> NFRs are not backlog items themselves
   -> NFRs are constraints on backlog items
