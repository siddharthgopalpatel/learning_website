<h4><pre>
1. Dark launches
   -> Separates deployment from release
   -> Enables testing and monitoring system behavior in the production environment before exposing new functionality to users

2. Feature toggles 
   -> Dynamically show and hide features in production
   -> Enable separation of deploy and release
   -> Enable rapid rollback of problem features
   -> Should be tested in both on and off position
   -> Be careful of toggle overload and testing complexity

3. Infrastructure as code
   -> Automates environment setup and teardown
   -> Manages all infrastructure assets and configurations in version control 
   -> Accelerates and de-risks deployment by provisioning gold copy environments on demand
   -> Enables infrastructure to always be in a deployable state

4. Deployment automation
   -> Automates the migration of changes into production environments
   -> Stores all environment information and package information in version control
   -> Increases deployment speed and reliability

5. Self service deployment
   -> Enables Agile teams to safely deploy their own changes to production
   -> Is sometimes called “push-button deployment” 
   -> Often provides complete automation from code commit to production deployment
   -> Can be done in compliance with change management controls

6. Selective deployment
   -> Enables deployment to select production targets or environments, such as:  
      — Servers
      — Data centers
      — Geography
   -> Enables more flexible and sophisticated release strategies
