<h4><pre>
1. Full-stack telemetry
   â€”> Gather proper data to monitor activities: 
      - Applications log and report meaningful activities and events
      - Applications and infrastructure are architected to support telemetry
      - Technical data and business data are monitored

2. Visual displays
   -> Make telemetry visible to the organization
   -> Use big visible information radiators (BVIR) to display the health of Solutions in prominent locations
   -> Visualize key DevOps Metrics
   -> Examples:
      - Time since last outage
      - Page response times
      - Usage analytics
      - Resource/compute utilization

3. Federated monitoring
   -> Display the data in dashboards and visualizations
   -> Use BVIRs to display the aggregated data
   -> Provide accessibility and ways to drill down to individual application and infrastructure telemetry

4. AIOps
   -> DevOps monitoring produces a flurry of data, events, and alerts
   -> AIOps provides infrastructure and capabilities that:
      - Aggregate, correlate, and analyze events
      - Separate meaningful events from the noise
      - Identify and predict root causes of issues
      - Significantly reduce mean time to restore (MTTR)
