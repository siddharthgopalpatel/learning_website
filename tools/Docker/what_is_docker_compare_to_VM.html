<h4><pre>
<h2>What is Docker? </h2>
-> Docker is an open-source Centralised Platform designed to create, deploy and run applications.

-> Docker uses container on the host O.S. to run applications. It allows applications to use the same linux kernel as a system on the host computer,
   rather than creating a whole virtual O.S.
   
-> We can install docker on any O.S. but Docker engine runs natively on linux distribution.

-> Docker written in 'go' language.

-> Docker is a tool that performs O.S. level virtualization, also knowns as Containerization.

-> Before Docker, many users faces the problem that a particular code is running in the developer's system but not in the user's system.

-> So, the main reason to develop docker to help developers to develop applications easily, ship them into containers, and can be deployed anywhere.

-> Docker was first release in March 2013. It is developed by Solomon Hykes and Sebastian Paul.

-> Docker is a set of platform as a service that uses O.S. level virtualization whereas VMware uses Hardware level virtualization.

-> Containers ensure that our application works in any environment like development, test or production.

-> Docker includes components such as Docker client, Docker server, Docker machine, Docker hub, Docker composes etc. 

<h2>Let's understand the Docker containers and Virtual Machine</h2>

<u>Docker Containers -</u> 
Docker Containers are lightweight alternatives of the virtual machine. It allows developers to package up the application with all its libraries and
dependencies, and ship it as a single package. The advantage of using docker container is that you don't need to allocate any RAM and disk space for
the applications. It automatically generates storage and space according to the application requirement.

<u>Virtual Machine -</u>
A Virtual Machine is a software that allows us to install ans use other operating systems (Windows, Linux, and Debian) simultaneously on our machine.
The operating system in which virtual runs are called virtualized operating systems. These virtualized operating systems can run programs and performs
tasks that we perform in a real operating system.
