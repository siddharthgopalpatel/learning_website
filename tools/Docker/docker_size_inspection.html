Docker Size Inspection
Letâ€™s look at how to find the size of Docker images and containers from the command line.

To view the approximate size of a running container, you can use the command docker container ls -s.
Running docker image ls shows the sizes of your images.
To see the size of the intermediate images that make up your image use docker image history my_image:my_tag.
Running docker image inspect my_image:tag will show you many things about your image, including the sizes of each layer. Layers are subtly different than the images that make up an entire image. But you can think of them as the same for most purposes. Check out this great article by Nigel Brown if you want to dig into layer and intermediate image intricacies.
Installing and using the dive package makes it easy to see into your layer contents.
