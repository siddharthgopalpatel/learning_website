<html><h2><u>Git Revert</u></h2>
<h4><pre>
1. Git revert command is used to apply revert operation or helps you to undo an existing commit. However, it is not a traditional undo alternative.
2. It doesnot delete any data in this process. Instead, git creates a new commit with the included files reverted to their previous state.
3. So, your version control history moves forward while the state of your file moves backward.

Example -> git revert

Git Revert Options:-
Git revert allows some additional operations like editing, no editing, cleanup and more. Let's understand these options briefly:

a. Commit:- The commit option is used to revert a commit. To revert a commit, we need the commit reference id. The git log command can access it.

Example -> git revert commit-ish

b. Edit:- It is used to edit the commit message before reverting the commit. It is default option in git revert command.

Example -> git revert -e commit-ish 

c. parent-number (-m or --mainline): It is used to revert the merging. Generally, we cannot revert a merge because we do not know which side of the merge should be considered as the mainline. We can specify the parent number and allows revert to reverse the change relative to the specified parent.

d. No edit (-n/ --no edit): This option will not open a text editor. It will directly revert the last commit.

example -> git revert -n commit-ish

e. Cleanup mode(--cleanup=mode): The cleanup option determines how to strip spaces and comments from the message.

f. No-commit (-n/--no-commit): Generally, the revert command commits by default. The no-commit option will not automatically comit. In addition,
                               if this option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD commit.
