<html><h2><u>Git Revert</u></h2>
<h4><pre>
Git revert command helps you to undo an existing commit.

-> It doesnot delete any data in this process instead. Rather git creates a new commit with the included files reverted to their previous state.
   So, your version control history moves forward while the state of your file moves backward.

reset -> before commit
revert -> after commit
