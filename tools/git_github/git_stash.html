<html><h2><u>Git Stashing</u></h2>
<h4><pre>
Suppose you are implementing a new feature for you product. Your code is in progress and suddenly a customer escalation comes. Because of this, you have
to keep aside your new feature work for few hours.
You cannot commit your partial code and also cannot throw away your changes. So you need some temporary storage, where you can store you partial changes
and later on commit it.
