<html><h2><u><center>Git Terminology</center></u></h2>
<pre><h4>

<h3><u>Git:-</u></h3>
-> Git is open-source distributed version control system which is available for everyone at zero cost. 
-> It is desinged to handle minor to major projects with speed and efficiency.
-> It is developed to co-ordinate the work among programmers.
-> The version control allows you to track and work together with your team member at the same workspace.

<h3><u>GitHub:-</u></h3>
-> GitHub is a Git repository hosting service.
-> GitHub also facilitates with many of its features, such as access control and collaboration.
-> It is web based graphical service.
-> GitHub facilitates with all of the features of ditributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git.
-> It also facilitates with some collboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management for every project.

<h3><u>Repository:-</u></h3>
-> Repository is a place where you have all your codes or kind of folder on server.
-> It is a kind of folder releated to one product.
-> Changes are personal to that particular Repository.

<h2><u>Server:-</u></h2>
-> It Stores all the Repositories.
-> It contains metadata also.

<h2><u>Working Directory/Workspace:-</u></h2>
-> Where you see files physically and do modification.
-> <mark>At a time, you can work on particular Branch.</mark>

<mark> In other CVCs, developers generally makes modifications and commit their changes directly to the Repository. But git uses different strategy.
Whenever you do commit an operation, git looks for the file present in the staging area. Only those files present in the staging area are considered
for commit and not all the modified files.</mark>

<h2><u>Commit:-</u></h2>
-> Store changes in the repository. You will get one Commit-ID.
-> It is 40 alpa-numeric characters.
-> It uses SHA-1 checksum concept.
-> Even if you change one dot, Commit-ID will get change.
-> It actullay helps you to track the changes.
-> Commit is also names as SHA1 hash.

<h2><u>Commit ID/ Version-ID/ Version:-</u></h2>
-> Reference to identify each change.
-> To identify who changed the file.

<h2><u>Tags:-</u></h2>
Tags assign a meaningful name with a specific version in the repository. Once a tag is created for a particular save, even if you create a new commit,
it will not be updated.  

<h2><u>Snapshots:-</u></h2>
-> Represents some data of particular time.
-> <mark>It is always incremental i.e. It stores the changes (appended data) only. Not entire copy.</mark>

<h2><u>Push:-</u></h2> Push operations copies changes from local repository instances to a remote or central repo. This is used to store the changes permanently into the
git repository.

<h2><u>Pull:-</u></h2> Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repository to a local machine. The pull operation is used for synchronisation between two repo.

<h2><u>Branch:-</u></h2> Product is some, so one repository but different task.
-> Each task has one separate Branch.
-> Finally merges(code) all Branches.
-> Useful when you want to work paralley.
-> Can create one branch on the basis of another Branch.
-> Default Branch is 'Master'.
-> File created in workspace will be visible in any of the branch workspace untill you commit. Once you commit, then that file belongs to that particular Branch.

<h2><u>Advantages of Git:-</u></h2>
-> Free and Open Source.
-> Fast and Small (as most of the operations are performed locally, therefore it is fast.
-> Security (Git uses a common Cryptographic hash function called Secure hash function (SHA-1) to name and identify objects within its database.
-> No need of powerful hardware.
-> Easier Branching (If we create a new branch, it will copy all the codes to the new branch. 

<h2><u>Types of Repositories:-</u></h2>

<u>1. Bare Repositories (Central Repo.)</u>
-> Store and share only.
-> All central repositories are Bare Repo.

<u>2. Non-Bare Repositories (Local Repo)</u>
-> Where you can modify the files.
-> All local repositories are non-bare repositories.
