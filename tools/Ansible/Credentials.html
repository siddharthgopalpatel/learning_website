<html><h2><u><center>Credentials</center></u></h2>
<pre><h4>
Suppose we run the ping module on all three nodes. This module logs in to the nodes to check if Ansible is ready to run. It checks the credentials used for login.

Note: This is completely different from the ping command which sends ICMP used in networking. We are running ping as an Ansible module.
In this exercise environment, the authentication information is specified in the inventory. 

Now login to node04 container using the below command.
sudo docker exec -it node04 /bin/bash

Now install SSH on node04.
apt update && apt install ssh -y

allow password authentication on node04(ansible will use password authentication to talk to this server)
sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication/PasswordAuthentication/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Make sure it is uncommented now using - 
grep 'PasswordAuthentication ' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Create ubuntu user
useradd -m ubuntu -s /bin/bash

set the password to ubuntu123
passwd ubuntu

Start the ssh service 
service ssh start

Now exit from mode node04, and type exit.

And login back to ansible node using sudo docker exec -it ansibleserver /bin/bash

Check the inventory 
cat ansible/hosts2
[server]
node01
node02
node03
node04

[all:vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

We define [all:vars] as a variable for all groups, and define the variables for authentication there.

ansible_user: Specify the username that Ansible will use to log in.
ansible_ssh_private_key_file: Specify the private key that Ansible will use for login.

Run the below command to check the connectivity.

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ansible all -u ubuntu -m ping -i ansible/hosts2
node04 | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ubuntu@node04: Permission denied (publickey,password).",
    "unreachable": true
}
node01 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node02 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node03 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

We're getting the error because ssh keys are not placed on the node04 server. To fix this run the below command 
sed -i 's/node04/node04 ansible_password=ubuntu123/' ansible/hosts2

In this exercise, we use the private key, but you can also specify a password for login. We're using a password to login to node04.
Note: To use this feature install sshpass on ansible node using the below command. 
sudo apt install sshpass -y

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ cat ansible/hosts2
[server]
node01
node02
node03
node04 ansible_password=ubuntu123

[all:vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa


ansible_password : Specify The password that Ansible will use to log in.

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ansible all -u ubuntu -m ping -i ansible/hosts2
node03 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node01 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node04 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node02 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

Now, let's remove the ansible_password=ubuntu123 from the inventory using below command. 

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ sed -i 's/node04 ansible_password=ubuntu123/node04/' ansible/hosts2
ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ cat ansible/hosts2
[server]
node01
node02
node03
node04

[all:vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa


Several other methods of giving credentials are also provided. One of the most common is to give it as a command line option.

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ansible all -u ubuntu --private-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa -m ping -i ansible/hosts2
node04 | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ubuntu@node04: Permission denied (publickey,password).",
    "unreachable": true
}
node02 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node01 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node03 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

We're getting the error because ssh keys are not placed on the node04 server.

-u ubuntu: Specify the user name to use for login.
--private key: Specify the private key to use for login.

You can also use a password. The following is a sample.

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ansible all -u ubuntu -k -m ping -i ansible/hosts2
SSH password:  ← You'll be asked to enter the password here.
node04 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

Note: In this exercise environment, the private key is set in the inventory file, so the operation will succeed even if the wrong password(the password should be right for node04 as there are no ssh keys present on that node) is 
entered because the key authentication is given priority. 
-k: Prompts for the password when the command is executed.
There are several other ways to pass authentication information to Ansible. In this exercise, we use the most basic and convenient method (direct specification with variables). 
However, when you use it in production, you need to carefully consider how to handle the authentication information in advance. Of course, authentication information written directly in the file can 
be used by anyone who has access to the file for other purposes (such as illegally operating the server).

In general, it is often used in combination with automation platform software such as Ansible Automation Platform or AWX.
