Ansible names came from the sc-fie book where it was a device which communicates to another universe without any time delay.
Snowflake servers -> A snow flake server is a server that  is something that you set up by hand oor you have manual processes invloved in managing
that server, and you can't get the server back to a clean state with a click of a button or running one command.

Ansible allows you to run some commnads in background.
-B = How long you allow the job to run in sec (if the job will run more than specified time, then Ansible will kill it. Just to make sure the job sould not run forever)
-P = Gives the pulling time in seconds. This is how often Ansible will check if job is completed or not.
Example -> ansible -i inventory multi -b -B 3600 -P 0 -a "yum -y update"
After running this command you will get result file. In the result filem you will job id. The job id can be used to check the status of the command later.
Example -> ansible -i inventory multi -b -m async_status -a "jid=...."
It good to log the above task somewhere, because ansible will not let you know in case if it fails, you have to do it manually.

For idempotence, what if you want to use a task like update_cache on Debian/Ubuntu?

How to get the better result or representation of setup output.

==========================
Enviroment variable can be set in four formats
1. Normal user level
2. Global level
3. Task level / task based environemntal setting
4. Playbook level

1,2 would be persistent and 3,4 would not

1. Normal user level

          - name: Add environmental variable to the remote user's shell
            lineinfile:

======================

===========Environment variables ============
1. For setting environment varibale globally
/etc/environment

2. Setting environmnet variable at user level 

          - name: Add an environment vatiable to the remote user's shell
            lineinfile:
                    dest: "~/.bash_profile"
                    regex: '^ENV_VAR1='
                    line: 'ENV_VAR1=value1' 
            become: no
            #hosts: amazonhost
          - name: Get the valye of environment variable
            shell: 'source ~/.bash_profile && echo $ENV_VAR'
            register: foo
            become: no

          - debug: msg="The variable is {{ foo.stdout }}"
            become: no

2. Task based environment setting
	see the video, episode 5 time 34:14

3. Playbook based environment setting

1,2 will be persisted but 3,4 won't be persisted. 3,4 will insert again  or change after every playbook run 

4. Centos, RedHat, Fedora are same OS, ubuntu, Debain are a same

5. Variable + with_first_found module 

6. vars, vars_files and include_vars are some different way of assinging variables in playbook

7. accessing variable from debug -> debug: var=foo.rc or debug: var=foo['rc']

8. import_tasks and include_tasks does the same thing, getting the task or other information from the other file. However, include used for dynamic variable.
   Always use import, if something breaks switch it to include.

8. You can put register in all the task to check the output

9. You can even include playbook, import_playbook

Playbook execution to push MOTD to all servers

Your team has had mistakes because users don't know what server they've jumped into, specifically DEV or PROD environments. You have decided to push a message of the day file (MOTD) to all servers to help them know what systems they are on.

MOTD stands for Message of the Day, which is a message that is displayed to a user when they log in to a computer system or network. MOTDs are often used to inform users of important information or upcoming events

Verify your hosts file and motd_push.yaml file

Push the motd messages to all servers based on the new variables assigned in the hosts file.

cat hosts
[server]
node01 env=prod
node02 env=dev
node03 env=test


controlplane $ cat dev_motd

      src: dev_motd
      dest: "/etc/motd"
    when: '"dev" in env'
	
Note: There are variables now assigned to each of the servers (env)

Run the Playbook push the MOTD

ansible-playbook -i hosts motd_push.yaml
Run an adhoc command to check all the MOTD on all servers

ansible server -i hosts -m shell -a 'cat /etc/motd'
Manually check by logging into node01

ssh node01 'cat /etc/motd'

===============================
Playbook execution to create users

Your engineering team needs to push service accounts for new users and teams to some of your systems. You have decided to do that in Ansible.

Verify your /root/hosts file, and /root/user_create.yaml files. You may note that the hosts file has variables set that we will be using to push the correct files in our first playbook.

Push the user prod_engineer to the prod servers and the dev_engineer user to the dev servers.

controlplane $ cat hosts 
[server]
node01 env=prod
node02 env=dev
node03 env=test

cat user_create.yaml
Note: This will push users to the servers

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ cat user_create.yaml
---
- name: User push to environment servers
  hosts: server
  vars:
  gather_facts: True
  become: True
  tasks:

  - name: Debug env variables just to see them
    debug:
      var: env

  - name: Create the prod_engineer user
    user:
      name: prod_engineer
      comment: Prod engineer
    when: '"prod" in env'

  - name: Create the dev_engineer user and give root group
    user:
      name: dev_engineer
      group: root
      comment: Dev engineer
    when: '"dev" in env'

  - name: Create the test_engineer user and give root group
    user:
      name: test_engineer
      group: root
      comment: Test engineer
    when: '"test" in env'

	
Run the Playbook push the users.
ansible-playbook -i hosts user_create.yaml
Run an ad hoc command to verify users were added and place in groups.

ansible server -i hosts -m shell -a "tail -1 /etc/passwd"
ansible server -i hosts -m shell -a "ls -ltr /home"	

Verify your user_key_add.yaml file. You may note that the hosts file has variables set that we will be using to push the correct files in our first playbook.

Modify and generate keys for the users.

cat user_key_add.yaml
Note: This will generate keys for the existing users.

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ cat user_key_add.yaml
---

- name: User push to environment servers
  hosts: server
  vars:
  gather_facts: True
  become: True
  tasks:

  - name: Debug env variables just to see them
    debug:
      var: env

  - name: Create the prod_engineer user
    user:
      name: prod_engineer
      comment: Prod engineer
      generate_ssh_key: yes
      ssh_key_bits: 2048
      ssh_key_file: .ssh/id_rsa
    when: '"prod" in env'

  - name: Create the dev_engineer user and give root group
    user:
      name: dev_engineer
      comment: Dev engineer
      groups: root
      generate_ssh_key: yes
      ssh_key_bits: 2048
      ssh_key_file: .ssh/id_rsa
    when: '"dev" in env'

  - name: Create the test_engineer user and give root admin
    user:
      name: test_engineer
      comment: Test engineer
      groups: root
      generate_ssh_key: yes
      ssh_key_bits: 2048
      ssh_key_file: .ssh/id_rsa
    when: '"test" in env'


Run the Playbook push the users.

ansible-playbook -i hosts user_key_add.yaml
Run an ad hoc command to verify keys were added to the users.

ansible server -i hosts -m shell -a "ls /home/*engineer/.ssh" -b

================================
Playbook execution update packages

Your team has been tasked to update all servers in the environment to maintain compliance with your GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) Security team. You also need to configure some new servers for software in the environment.

Verify your hosts file
controlplane $ cat hosts 
[server]
node01 node_type=db
node02 node_type=web
node03 node_type=app


and packages_update.yaml files. You may note that the hosts file has variables set that we will be using to push the correct files in our first playbook. Update all the packages to the newest version
Note: This will update all current packages on the server, it may take 5 minutes or more to do that. 
Run the Playbook update all the packages.

cat packages_update.yaml
controlplane $ cat packages_update.yaml 
---
- name: Upgrade Packages
  hosts: server
  vars:
  gather_facts: True
  become: True
  tasks:

  - name: Upgrade all packages to the latest version
    apt:
      name: "*"
      state: latest

ansible-playbook -i hosts packages_update.yaml

controlplane $ cat packages_install.yaml 
---
- name: Package install for environment
  hosts: server
  vars:
  gather_facts: True
  become: True
  tasks:

  - name: Debug env variables just to see them
    debug:
      var: node_type

  - name: Install apache2 on the web server
    apt:
      pkg: 
      - apache2
      - php
      state: present
    when: '"web" in node_type'

  - name: Install mariadb on the web server
    apt:
      pkg: 
      - mariadb-server
      - mariadb-client
      state: present
    when: '"db" in node_type'

ansible-playbook -i hosts packages_install.yaml


Verify your packages_install.yaml file. You may note that the hosts file has variables set that we will be using to install packages on the right servers.



Run it again to see that nothing has to change. This demonstrates idempotency, where the result of the previous run is the same in subsequent runs.

Playbook execution remove security violations

Lab Activities
You cleaned up the golden image over in lab Updating Golden Image. Now your team needs you to deploy that change to all the active systems.

Verify your /root/hosts file, /root/remove_packages.j2 and /root/remove_packages.yaml files.

Remove the bzip2 and containerd packages from all servers to ensure that old software is no longer on your systems and to stop developer abuse of containerd on all systems.


Solution
cat /root/hosts
cat /root/remove_packages.yaml
You may want to remove the commented debug variables before you run this. What are the individual tasks attempting to do with this playbook?

Now that we've reviewed the playbook, let's look at the Jinja2 template that will be stamped to this server at the end of the execution.

cat /root/remove_packages.j2
What are the variables being used? what are the expected outcomes?

Run the playbook to see the removal of packages from all servers.

ansible-playbook -i /root/hosts /root/remove_packages.yaml
Did the playbook execute with no issues? If it did not, run it again and see what the output is.

Verify the output of the reports that you've run.

for report in $(ls /root/*report*.txt); do echo "checking $report"; cat $report; done
Are the output reports what you expected? Why or why not?

Generate CSV report 
https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Ansible-Labs/19-Ansible-csv-report
========================================
Create a playbook to push web and database environment.

Lab Activities
Your team has a deployment of a web server and database environment. They want to secure the environment so that only the ports that should be exposed are exposed on the correct servers. 
You have researched and found that UFW can do this and you can configure it with Ansible in a playbook.

Setup the servers to expose the correct port numbers.

Web Server - Port 22, 80
DB Server - Port 22, 3306

Make sure that you can connect to those servers on the exposed ports.

You may try to complete this activity yourself, or you may find the answers in the Solution below.

Check your hosts file, cat hosts
ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ cat hosts
[server]
node01 node_type=db
node02 node_type=web
node03 node_type=app


Check on the environment deployer, or compare it to what you tried to write. How do they compare? How do they differ?

---
- name: Package install for environment
  hosts: server
  vars:
  gather_facts: True
  become: True
  tasks:

  - name: Debug env variables just to see them
    debug:
      var: node_type

  - name: Install apache2 on the web server
    apt:
      pkg:
      - apache2
      - php
      state: present
    when: '"web" in node_type'

  - name: starting the apache2 on web server
    service:
            name: apache2
            state: started
    when: '"web" in node_type'

  - name: Install mariadb on the DB server
    apt:
      pkg:
      - mariadb-server
      - mariadb-client
      state: present
    when: '"db" in node_type'

  - name: starting the mariadb on DB server
    service:
            name: mariadb
            state: started
    when: '"web" in node_type'

Execute the packages_install.yaml to set up your web and db environments.

Run against the [server] host group

ansible-playbook -i hosts packages_install.yaml
When this executes, do you notice that it skips servers? Why is it doing this, and is it expected?

Verify that you have all the expected ports open on both servers
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install netcat -y

timeout 3 nc -vz node01 3306
timeout 3 nc -vz node01 22
timeout 3 nc -vz node02 80
timeout 3 nc -vz node02 22

If this has all worked, you've completed this part of the lab and are ready to move on.
