<html><h3><u>Playbook to stage and deploy tar file</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
Create a playbook to stage and deploy an application

Let's assume you're developing an application which just echo some lines in an interval of 5 seconds

Create folder
mkdir deploy

Create a file inside it
vi deploy/deployer.sh 
#!/bin/bash

echo "I would be deploying some stuff."

sleep 5

echo "I would be deploying some more stuff."

Let's tar the folder 
tar -cvzf deploy.tar.gz deploy

Get sha1 checksum of the archive. (Check why checksum is different)

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ sha1sum deploy.tar.gz
0cb7d3743ff5bbd340e8111a495be5f787acd59d  deploy.tar.gz

Create a deploy playbook called deploy.yml to push the file deploy.tar.gz over to the /home/ubuntu directory on all servers, unpackage it, and run the installer.sh.
Make sure that the playbook runs to completion and sets the environment as you need it

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ cat deploy.yml

- name: Start of Deployer playbook

    - name: Copy deploy.tar.gz over at {{ ansible_date_time.iso8601_basic_short }}

        dest: deploy.tar.gz
        checksum: 0cb7d3743ff5bbd340e8111a495be5f787acd59d  ## Paste your checksum here

    - name: Untar the deployer
      unarchive:
        src: deploy.tar.gz
        dest: .
        remote_src: yes

      file:
        path: deploy/deployer.sh
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Run the installer and register the output
      shell: deploy/deployer.sh
      register: installer_output

    - name: Debug and show the variable installer_output
      debug:
        var: installer_output

		
Run Playbook and verify that everything pushed correctly
