<html><h3><u>Roles</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
So far, we have listed modules directly on the playbook. The automation using Ansible is possible in this way, but when you actually use Ansible, you often want to reuse previous operations. Copying and pasting 
previous codes at that time is not efficient, but when you call the entire other playbook, most of them do not work well because the group name written in hosts: and the inventory do not match. What appears there
is the idea of Role.

Automation can be partized in various units of work to make reusable parts. Role is completely separated from the inventory and can be called and used in various playbooks. This method of developing and managing 
playbooks is called best practice(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/tips_tricks/ansible_tips_tricks.html) in Ansible.

Note: A module is a component of the tasks that occur frequently in the infrastructure, but a role is a component that summarizes the steps that occur frequently in your organization or project.

<u>Role Structure</u>
Role places files in the directory in a predetermined configuration. Then, the directory can be called from Ansible as Role .

The representative role structure is listed below.

site.yml        # Invoking playbook
roles/          # Ansible determines that the Role is stored in the Role directory of the same layer as the Playbook.     
  your_role/    # A directory that stores a role called your_role. (Directory name = role name)
    tasks/      #
      main.yml  #  Describe the tasks you want to perform in the role.
    handlers/   #
      main.yml  #  Write a handler to use within the role.
    templates/  #
      ntp.conf.j2  # Describe the template used in the role.
    files/      #
      bar.txt   #  Place the files to be used in the role.
      foo.sh    #
    defaults/   #
      main.yml  #  List the variables and default values used in the role.
  your_2nd_role/   # The role is called your_2nd_role.

When creating a directory structure as described above, site.yml can call roles as follows:

---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - import_role:
      name: your_role

  - include_role:
      name: your_2nd_role

In this way, processing can be called simply by specifying the name of the role using a module called import_role, include_role .Both modules call roles, and the differences are as follows.

import_role => Load roles before running playbook（pre-read）
include_role => Roles are loaded when performing tasks (post-read)
Note: You don't have to be aware of the distinction between the two at this time. Basically, using import_role is safer and simpler.include_role is used to describe complex operations, such as dynamically 
changing the role called by operation.
The procedure part is partized as Role and managed separately from the automation object, and Playbook manages which role to apply sequentially to which host group.

Create Role
It's not difficult to actually write a role. It's just dividing the processing you've written so far into a set directory.

In this exercise, we create a web_setup role to set up a web server. It becomes the following directory structure.

role_playbook.yml     # Playbook that actually calls the role
roles
└── web_setup              # Role name
    ├── defaults
    │   └── main.yml       # Store default values of variables
    ├── files
    │   └── apache2.conf     # Store files to be distributed
    ├── handlers
    │   └── main.yml       # Define handler
    ├── tasks
    │   └── main.yml       # Describe task
    └── templates
        └── index.html.j2  # Place template files
Create each file.

Create Task File
mkdir -p roles/web_setup/tasks/
Edit roles/web_setup/tasks/main.yml

---
- name: install apache2
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: latest

- name: start & enabled apache2
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
    enabled: yes

- name: Put index.html from template
  template:
    src: index.html.j2
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html

- name: Copy Apache configuration file
  copy:
    src: apache2.conf
    dest: /etc/apache2/conf/
  notify:
    - restart_apache

Place only the tasks you want to perform in the tasks directory. Also, there is no need to write the play part in the role, so we will list only the tasks. 
The templates, files directory in the role can be referenced only by the file name in the module without explicitly specifying a path. For this reason, only the file name is described in src 
of the copy and template modules.

Create handler file
mkdir -p roles/web_setup/handlers/
Edit roles/web_setup/handlers/main.yml

---
- name: restart_apache
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: restarted

Place only the processing you want to call as a handler in the handlers directory.

Create Default Variables
mkdir -p roles/web_setup/defaults/
Edit roles/web_setup/defaults/main.yml

---
LANG: Hindi

In defaults , place the default value of the variable to be used within this Role. The Role default variable has a low overwrite priority, so you can overwrite and run it on the called Playbook side. 
Also, be careful not to duplicate variable names because this variable can be referenced from the entire Playbook when Role is called.

Note: In general, variable names used in Role are often given Role names as prefixes.

Edit template file
mkdir -p roles/web_setup/templates/
Edit roles/web_setup/templates/index.html.j2

&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This server is running on {{ inventory_hostname }}.&lt;/h1&gt;

{% if LANG == "Hindi" %}
     Namaste!
{% else %}
     Hello!
{% endif %}
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

In templates , place the template file used by the template module. Files placed here will be accessible only by file name from a specific module called in Role.

Create distribution file
mkdir -p roles/web_setup/files/
Edit roles/web_setup/files/apache2.conf

This file is retrieved from the server side. Please edit the file after executing the command as follows to retrieve the file.

cd roles/web_setup

ansible node01 -b -m yum -a 'name=apache2 state=latest'

ansible node01 -m fetch -a 'src=/etc/apache2/apache2.conf dest=files/apache2.conf flat=yes'

Verify that the file has been retrieved.

ls -l files/

Edit the contents of the file. Depending on how the exercise progresses, it may have already been edited, so please leave it as it is.

ServerAdmin root@localhost
      ↓
ServerAdmin centos_role@localhost

In files , place files that Role uses for distribution, etc. This directory is also accessible only by filename from within Role to specific modules.

Create playbook
Edit role_playbook.yml

Create a playbook that actually calls the role.

---
- name: using role
  hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - import_role:
        name: web_setup

Review all
Verify the role you created.

tree roles

The necessary files are ready if they are structured as follows.

roles
└── web_setup
    ├── defaults
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── files
    │   └── apache2.conf
    ├── handlers
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── tasks
    │   └── main.yml
    └── templates
        └── index.html.j2

Executing
Run the created playbook.

ansible-playbook role_playbook.yml

The use of roles dramatically improves automation reuse. This is because tasks and inventory are completely separate. However, if you proceed with Role and Playbook at will, your description style will be 
shattered and management will be difficult.

Therefore, by establishing a certain rule called best practice, the outlook for where and what is defined will be improved, and other members will be able to reuse the role with confidence.
