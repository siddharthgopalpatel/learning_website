<h3><u>Ansible Inventory -</u></h3>
-> Ansible can work simultaneously with multiple systems in your infrastructure.
-> To work with multiple servers, Ansible needs to establish connectivity to those servers.
-> This is done with SSH for Linux and PowerShell remoting for Windows which would make Ansible agentless.
-> Agentless means you don't need to install any additional software on the Target machines to be able to work with Ansible.
-> One of the major disadvantages of the other automation tools is that you need to install and configure agents on the target machines before you can invoke any kind of 
   automation.
-> Now the information about these target systems is stored in an inventory file.
-> <mark>If you don't create a new inventory file Ansible uses its default inventory file located at /etc/ansible/hosts.</mark>
-> The inventory file is an INI-like format. But it can be YAML and others. 
-> It's simply several servers listed one after the others.
-> You can define a group of groups.
-> You can also give an alias name to any server listed in the inventory file.
-> You can create a host and inventory file based on your project under the project directory, the global one would be /etc/ansible location.

Let's take a look at the contents of the file.

cat ansible/hosts1
[server]
node01 ansible_host=172.18.0.3
node02 ansible_host=172.18.0.4
node03 ansible_host=172.18.0.5

[all:vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

This inventory is written in the form of an ini file. It also supports other formats such as YAML and Dynamic Inventory which dynamically configure the inventory with scripts. 
For more details, please check How to build your inventory. https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html

This inventory file is described by the following rules.

Information is described by one node per line, such as node01 and node02.
A node line consists of the identifier of the node (node01) and host variable(s) to be given to the node (i.e. ansible_host=xxxx).
You can also specify an IP address or FQDN at node01 place.
You can create a group of hosts like a server.
You can use any group name. For example [web] [app] [db] is used to group the system
In [all:vars], group variables are defined for the group all.
All is a special group, a group that points to all nodes described in the inventory.
The ansible_user, ansible_ssh_private_key_file given here is a special variable that points to the username and SSH private key path used to login to each node.

A magic variable represented by ansible_xxxx , which contains special values that control Ansible's behavior and environment information that Ansible will automatically retrieve. 
Details are explained in the variables section.
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/special_variables.html

Let's try to run Ansible against nodes defined using inventory. Please run the following command.

ansible server -i ansible/hosts1 -m ping -o

node02 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}
node03 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}
node01 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}

The meanings of the options for this command are as follows.

server : Specifies a group in the inventory.
-i hosts1 : Specifies the inventory file to use.
-m ping : Runs the module ping . Details about the module are described later.
-o : Summarize the output into one line per node.

If you want to use default inventory in our case /etc/ansible/hosts, you can omit -i  as follows.
ansible server -m ping -o

node02 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}
node01 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}
node03 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}

It is also possible to specify the node name instead of the group name.
ansible node01 -m ping -o

node01 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}

It is also possible to specify multiple nodes.
ansible node01,node02 -m ping -o

node02 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}
node01 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}

Let's specify a special group, all . The all group covers all the nodes in the inventory. 
ansible all -m ping -o

node02 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}
node03 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}
node01 | SUCCESS => {"ansible_facts": {"discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"},"changed": false,"ping": "pong"}

In the example so far, Ansible performs some kind of execution (in this case, ping) on the specified group, but it is also possible to check only the target nodes without execution. 
In this case, use the --list-hosts option.

ansible server --list-hosts
  hosts (3):
    node01
    node02
    node03

ansible node02 --list-hosts
  hosts (1):
    node02



view the inventory with ansible-inventory to see the host groups.
ansible-inventory --list

To see that in graph output use this command.
ansible-inventory --graph

To see that in yaml output.
ansible-inventory --list -y
Which of those output were most useful to you? Which of them do you think you'd like to see or use for your environments?
