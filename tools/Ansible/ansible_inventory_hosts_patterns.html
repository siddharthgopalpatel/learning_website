<html><h3>Ansible Inventory and Host Patterns<h3>
<pre><h4>
=> vi /etc/ansible/hosts

=> "all" pattern refers to all the machines in an inventory

=> ansible all --list-hosts
=> ansible [group-name] --list-hosts
=> ansible [group-name][0] --list-hosts 

groupname[0] -> picks first machine of group
groupname[1] -> picks second machine of group
groupname[-1] -> picks last machine of the group
groupname[0:1] -> picks first two machine in the group
groupname[2:5] -> picks 3,4,5 and 6 machine in the group

Group separated by a colon can be used to use hosts from multiple groups
=> groupname1:groupname2
