<html><h3>Ansible Ad-hoc Commands</h3>
<h4><pre>
Ad-hoc Commands are commands which can be run individually to perform quick functions.

=> These ad-hoc commands are not used for configuration Management and deployment, because these commands are of one time usage.

=> The ansible ad-hoc commands uses the /usr/bin/ansible command line tool to automate a single task.

Some ad-hoc commands - 
1. ansible demo -a "ls"
2. ansible demo[0:4] -a "touch file"
3. ansible all -a "touch file4"
4. ansible demo -a "sudo yum install httpd -y" or ansible demo -ba "yum install httpd -y"
5. ansible demo -ba "yum remove httpd -y"
