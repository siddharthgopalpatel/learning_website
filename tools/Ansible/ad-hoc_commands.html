<html><h3>Ansible Ad-hoc Commands</h3>
<h4><pre>
=> Ad-hoc Commands are commands that can be run individually to perform quick functions.
=> These ad-hoc commands are not used for configuration Management and deployment, because these commands are of one-time usage.
=> The ansible ad-hoc commands use the /usr/bin/ansible command line tool to automate a single task.
=> If you run an ansible ad-hoc command without the module command, it will always show changed because you're not using the ansible module.
=> If you don't pass the module in ad-hoc commands, then Ansible takes the command module by default.
=> We use the ad-hoc command to check on the resources and logs, in the case of debugging, restarting the server, manager user or group, rebooting the server and maintaining cron jobs, etc.
=> The Ansible command module doesn't handle pipe or redirections. You can use the shell module to do the same task.
=> >, | => used in playbook on command module

In this section, You will learn about the Module which is the important element in Ansible, and the Ad-hoc command to run the module.

What is a Module?


List of modules
Modules are managed in the form of `collection', and each collection contains multiple related modules. 

You can see what modules are available in your environment with the ansible-doc command. This command lists installed modules.
ansible-doc -l
Note: Proceed with f, return with b, end with q.

Count the number of modules the ansible has in the installed version
ansible-doc -l | wc -l

Read the documentation on the setup module (may have to hit q to exit)

ansible-doc -s setup
Read the documentation on the copy module (may have to hit q to exit)

ansible-doc -s copy

Note: Proceed with f, return with b, end with q.
The module documentation describes the parameters given to the module, the return values after the module is executed, and examples of actual usage.

Ad-hoc command
You can call only one of these modules from Ansible to make Ansible do small things. This method is called the Ad-hoc command.

The command format is as follows:

$ ansible all -m module_name -a 'parameters'
-m module_name: Specifies the module name.
-a parameters: Specifies the parameters to be passed to the module. In some cases, it can be optional.

Let's take advantage of the Ad-hoc command to get some modules working.

ping
Let's run the ping module. This is a module that determines whether Ansible can "communicate as Ansible" to the node it is working on (which is different from the ICMP used in the network). 
Ping module parameters are optional.

ansible all -m ping


shell - This executes arbitrary commands on the node and retrieves the results.

ansible all -m shell -a 'hostname'

Get kernel information
ansible all -m shell -a 'uname -a'

Get a date
ansible all -m shell -a 'date'

Get disk usage
ansible all -m shell -a 'df -h'

Extract specific information from installed packages
ansible all -m shell -a 'apt list --installed 2>/dev/null |grep bash'

apt
apt is the module that performs package operations. Try installing a new package using this module.
Install the apache2 package. First, verify that apache2 is not installed in your environment.

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ansible node01 -m shell -a 'which apache2'
node01 | FAILED | rc=1 >>
non-zero return code

This command should fail because the apache2 does not exist.

Then, install apache2 using the apt module.
ansible node01 -b -m apt -a 'name=apache2 state=latest'


-b/--become: become option. This is an option to operate on the node you are connecting to as root privileges. This option is added because installing the package requires root privileges. Otherwise, this command will fail.

If you check the apache2 package again, it should succeed because the package is installed this time.

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ansible node01 -m shell -a 'which apache2'
node01 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
/usr/sbin/apache2


setup (Ad Hoc to gather data)
The setup module gives so much information you can use during playbook execution.
ansible server -m setup

Cut that output down a bit so you can just check the host distribution information.

ansible server -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_distribution'

Cut that output down a bit so you can just check the host time information.

ansible server -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_date_time'

<u><h3>Forks and Parallelization</h3></u>
1. If you run the same ad-hoc command multiple times, it will not run in the sequential order on the group mentioned in the inventory. 
2. There would be a chance that the group mentioned in the inventory file will get executed randomly.
3. This is because Ansible by default runs in a parallel nature i.e. by default it uses 5 forks.
4. You can change the behavior by mentioning -f in ad-hoc commands.
5. If you mention -f 1, then it will run sequentially. It will run on the one server and wait for it to respond and then it will execute the command on another one.

In the example below we didn't use fork so the node result came randomly i.e. node03, node01 and then node02
ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ansible all -m ping
node03 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node01 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node02 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}


In the examplew below you can see all the three nodes came in other i.e. node01, node02 and then node03.
Example -> ansible server -m ping -f 1

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ansible server -m ping -f 1
node01 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node02 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
node03 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}


6. If you have a lot of servers then you can fork 100, to get the result or finish the task fast.
