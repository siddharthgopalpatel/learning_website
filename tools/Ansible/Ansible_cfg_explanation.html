<html><h3><u>ansible.cfg Explanation</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
Run the following command on ansible server.
ansible all -m shell -a 'df -h'
Note: Please ignore the command details. The important thing is that df -h has been executed.
Note: The df command retrieves the usage status of the disks on the server

Now we can get disk usage information from three nodes. But how were these three nodes determined? Some of you may be wondering where that information is set in Ansible. 

We'll go over the settings. If you run the ansible command with the --version option, it will output some basic information about the execution environment. This includes the version and the Python version you are using. 

ansible --version
ansible 2.9.6
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/home/ubuntu/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.8.10 (default, Jul 29 2024, 17:02:10) [GCC 9.4.0]

Note: Output content may vary depending on the environment

Here we will focus on the following line.

config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

This shows the path to the Ansible configuration file that will be loaded. This file is a configuration file to control the basic behavior of Ansible.

Let's check out what this contains about inventory. Run the following command on the terminal.


ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ grep '#inventory  ' /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
#inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts

Note: This is the default value to ansible. It will be used by default, regardless of if it is commented out. 

This is a setting related to the "inventory" where Ansible decides which nodes to run the automation on.

Let's see what is there /etc/ansible/hosts file. 
ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ cat /etc/ansible/hosts
[server]
node01
node02
node03

So, from here ansible is deciding where to run the command to, which is called inventory. 

Now run the command as mentioned below:

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ cp /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg .

Make sure you got ansible.cfg file in the current directory.
ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ls -ltr ansible.cfg
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 20016 Sep 20 01:56 ansible.cfg

Now re-run the ansible --version command as mentioned below. 
ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ansible --version
ansible 2.9.6
  config file = /home/ubuntu/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/home/ubuntu/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.8.10 (default, Jul 29 2024, 17:02:10) [GCC 9.4.0]

See, the file location changed to /home/ubuntu/ansible.cfg. How did this happen?

Ansible Configuration File Precedence Order
Ansible uses a specific precedence order to determine which configuration file (ansible.cfg) to use for its operations. Here is the order in which Ansible searches for the configuration file:

1. The path given by the environment variable ANSIBLE_CONFIG: Firstly, Ansible will look at the configuration file specified by the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable if it is defined.
2. Current Directory: Ansible then looks for the configuration file in the current directory where the command is executed (./ansible.cfg).
3. Home Directory: If not found in the current directory, Ansible then searches for the configuration file in the home directory of the user executing the command (~/.ansible.cfg).
4. System-wide Configuration: Lastly, if none of the above are found, Ansible will fall back to the system-wide configuration file located at /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg.

So, Ansible searched the environment variable, then looked at the home directory and it found the configuration file. Hence showed in the ansible --version command.


Different ansible.cfg File Locations and Their Significance
1. Environment Variable ($ANSIBLE_CONFIG):
Significance: Users can specify a custom path to an ansible.cfg file by setting the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable. This gives users precise control over the configuration file used by Ansible commands.
Use Case: Essential for scenarios where configurations need to be dynamically switched or when using multiple configuration files for different environments or workflows.

2. Current Directory (./ansible.cfg):
Significance: This configuration file is the first one that Ansible tries to load. Having an ansible.cfg in the current directory allows for project-specific configurations.
Use Case: Ideal for managing configurations at a project level, ensuring that the settings are localized and not affecting other projects.
 

3. Home Directory (~/.ansible.cfg):
Significance: If the configuration file is not found in the current directory, Ansible will look for it in the home directory of the user running the command. This allows for user-specific configurations.
Use Case: Useful when different users on the same system need different Ansible configurations. It provides user-level customization without affecting global settings.
 
4. System-wide Configuration (/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg):
Significance: This is the system-wide configuration file used when no other files are found. It acts as a fallback and contains the default settings used by all Ansible commands system-wide.
Use Case: Suitable for defining global configurations that apply system-wide, ensuring consistency across all projects and users on the system.

Rememeber to remove ansible.cfg file to avoid any conflict with the original configuration.
rm -rf ansible.cfg
