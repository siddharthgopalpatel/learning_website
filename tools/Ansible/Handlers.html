<html><h3><u>Handlers</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
=> A handler is exactly the same as a task, but it will run when called by another task.
	or
=> Handlers are just like regular task in an ansible playbook, but are only run if the task contains a notify directive and also indicates that it changed something.
