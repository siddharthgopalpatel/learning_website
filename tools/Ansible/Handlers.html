<html><h3><u>Handlers</u></h3>
<h4><pre>

Handlers are similar to conditional expressions such as when clauses, but have more limited uses. Specifically, when a specific task becomes changed , it starts another task. As a typical use, there may be cases where the process is restarted into a set 
when a setting file is updated.

In the exercise, you will distribute apache2.conf to the server and create a playbook that will restart httpd when the file is updated.

First, get the apache2.conf you want to distribute from the server.

ubuntu@ansibleserver:~$ ansible node01 -m fetch -a 'src=/etc/apache2/apache2.conf dest=apache2.conf flat=yes'
node01 | CHANGED => {
    "changed": true,
    "checksum": "6a267335cb394ebf28b03aff70b0834524f124d0",
    "dest": "/home/ubuntu/apache2.conf",
    "md5sum": "20589b50379161ebc8cb35f761af2646",
    "remote_checksum": "6a267335cb394ebf28b03aff70b0834524f124d0",
    "remote_md5sum": null
}

ls -l apache2.conf


fetch module is a module that imports files from the remote server to local. (opposite to the copy module)
Edit handler_playbook.yml as follows:

---
- name: restart apache2 if apache2.conf is changed
  hosts: node01
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Copy Apache configuration file
      copy:
        src: apache2.conf
        dest: /etc/apache2/conf/
      notify:
        - restart_apache

  handlers:
    - name: restart_apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted

The handler consists of notify and handler .

Declare to send notify for the notify: handler, and specify the code that is actually sent after that.
- restart_apache It is specifying the code to be sent.
handlers: declare the handler section and describe the processing corresponding to the code sent below. - name: restart_apache : Perform this task as a handler by defining the name corresponding to restart_apache in notify .
Execute ~/working/handler_playbook.yml .

ansible-playbook handler_playbook.yml

PLAY [restart apache2 if apache2.conf is changed] *****************************************************************************************************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [node01]

TASK [Copy Apache configuration file] *****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [node01]

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
node01                     : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0

In this state, all tasks are ok . This is because at this point, apache2.conf from the server is distributed directly to the server, so changed does not occur. Therefore, handler will not start in the current state.

Note: This is because the idempotency of the copy module works. The file you tried to copy already exists and the contents are the same, so it is ok because you don't need to copy.
Then, edit apache2.conf and make the copy changed . Please edit the file as below.

Change the "LogLevel warn" to "LogLevel info".

Run handler_playbook.yml again.

ansible-playbook handler_playbook.yml

PLAY [restart apache2 if apache2.conf is changed] *****************************************************************************************************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [node01]

TASK [Copy Apache configuration file] *****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
changed: [node01]

RUNNING HANDLER [restart_apache] **********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
changed: [node01]

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
node01                     : ok=3    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0

Because of the update of apache2.conf , the 'copy' module became changed . Then the configured notify is called and restart_apache is running.

In this way, a method of executing another task with the trigger of changed of the task is a handler.

-==========================================================================
=> A handler is exactly the same as a task, but it will run when called by another task.
	or
=> Handlers are just like regular task in an ansible playbook, but are only run if the task contains a notify directive and also indicates that it changed something.
=> Don't presume handlers will run automatically, unless and untill it's been called from some another task and then status of the task is changing as well.
=> It will run at the end of the playbook, unless untill you're putting a task for meta flush handlers
=> You can define hanlders on the top or bottom because it's dicnory.
=> If you use --force-handlers on the ansible-playbook command, then handlers will get executed if the playbook fails also.
Example :- ansible-playbook -i inventory apache.yml --force-handlers
=> The handlers can have list, and can be called from another handlers.
