<html><h3><u>Vault</u></h3>
<h4><pre>

Your team has decided they need to more securely keep their secret information, instead of just passing values at the command line. You know that Ansible Vault can be used to securely store variables.

ubuntu $ cat variables.yaml 
---
- name: Variable output testing
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
  gather_facts: True
  become: False
  tasks:

    - name: Debug variables to view contents
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item }} is in variable list"
      loop:
        - "{{ username }}"
        - "{{ password }}"
		
Verify the functionality of the variables.yaml file by executing and giving extra-vars as needed.

ansible-playbook variables.yaml --extra-vars "username=user1 password=somestrongpassword"

Create a vault using Ansible. You will be asked to give a password, make sure you remember it.

ansible-vault create vault.yaml
Add the following information:

username: user1
password: somestrongpassword
Verify that you cannot read the file.

cat vault.yaml
View the vault with ansible-vault command. You will have to add in the password

ansible-vault view vault.yaml

Run the playbook vault_variables.yaml to see ansible run and use the vault variables.
ubuntu $ cat vault_variables.yaml 
---
- name: Variable output testing
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
  vars_files:
    - vault.yaml
  gather_facts: True
  become: False
  tasks:

    - name: Debug variables to view contents
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item }}"
      loop:
        - "Your Username is {{ username }}"
        - "Your Password is {{ password }}"

Solution
Run the Playbook variables.yaml. (You will have to put in your vault password)

ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass vault_variables.yaml
If we were using tower, we'd store credentials securely in there and it wouldn't matter. But, as it is we have an option to keep a password file. We can use that to decrypt the vault.

echo <your password> > .passfile
Make sure it's readable only by your user.

chmod 400 .passfile
Run the ansible playbook and consume that password file to decrypt the vault

ansible-playbook --vault-password-file=.passfile vault_variables.yaml

Check the current CI/CD for this work. Get an example. 


Ansible allows keeping sensitive data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files, rather than a plain text in your playbooks.

=> Creating a new encrypted playbook
   <mark>ansible-vault create vault.yml</mark>

=> Edit the encrypted playbook
   <mark>ansible-vault edit vault.yml</mark>
   
=> To change the password
   <mark>ansible-vault rekey vault.yml</mark>
   
=> To encrypt an exiting playbook
   <mark>ansible-vault encrypt target.yml</mark>
   
=> To decrypt an encrypted playbook
   <mark>ansible-vault decrypt target.yml</mark>
