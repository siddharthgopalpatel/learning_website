<html><h3><u>Variables</u></h3>
<h4><pre>
Variables can be used to increase the versatility of a playbook. In this section, you will learn how to use various variables.

<u>Basics of Variables</u>
Variables in Ansible have the following characteristics

They have no type
-> All are global variables (no scope)
-> Can be defined/overwritten in many different places
-> Because they are all global variables and can be defined and overwritten in various ways, it is useful to have a naming convention that defines the usage policy within the team.

For more information on where variables can be defined and what priority they have, please refer to the official documentation(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable).

In this exercise, we will learn how to use a typical variable.

<u>debug module</u>
To check the contents of the variables you have defined, the debug module is useful.

cat vars_debug_playbook.yml as follows.

---
- hosts: node01
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: print all variables
      debug:
        var: vars

    - name: get one variable
      debug:
        msg: "This value is {{ vars.ansible_version.full }}"
		
gather_facts: no -> Ansible will by default run the setup module to gather information about the node being operated on and set it to a variable before running the task. 
You can set this variable to no to skip the information collection. This is to make it easier to proceed with the exercise by reducing the amount of output of the variable list (the setup module collects a lot of information).
- debug:
   var: vars -> var option prints the contents of the variable given as an argument. Here we have given a variable named vars as an argument. vars is a special variable in which all variables are stored.
   msg: "This value is {{ vars.ansible_version.full }}" -> msg option will output any string. In it, the parts enclosed by {{ }} are expanded as variables.

Dictionary data in the variable will be retrieved as .keyname .
List data in the variable is retrieved as [index_number] .
Execute vars_debug_playbook.yml .
ansible-playbook vars_debug_playbook.yml

The content of vars shows the magic variables that Ansible defines by default.

Define Variables in the Playbook
Now let's actually define the variables.

Please edit vars_play_playbook.yml as follows.

---
- hosts: node01
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    play_vars:
      - order: 1st word
        value: ansible
      - order: 2nd word
        value: is
      - order: 3rd word
        value: fine
  tasks:
    - name: print play_vars
      debug:
        var: play_vars

    - name: access to the array
      debug:
        msg: "{{ play_vars[1].order }}"

    - name: join variables
      debug:
        msg: "{{ play_vars[0].value}} {{ play_vars[1].value }} {{ play_vars[2].value }}"
		
vars: If you write a vars: section in the play part, variables can be defined under it.
play_vars: This is the variable name. You can set it.
As a value, this variable creates a list with three elements, one for each of which is a dictionary data with the key order value .
msg: "{{ play_vars[1].order }}" Retrieves the 2nd order of the list.
msg: "{{ play_vars[0].value}} {{ play_vars[1].value }} {{ play_vars[2].value }}" As shown in this example, it is also possible to combine the values of multiple variables.

Let's run vars_play_playbook.yml .

ansible-playbook vars_play_playbook.yml


Defining Variables in the Task
It is possible to define variables to be used only within a single task, or to override them temporarily.

Let's edit vars_task_playbook.yml as follows.

---
- hosts: node01
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    task_vars: 100
  tasks:
    - name: print task_vars 1
      debug:
        var: task_vars

    - name: override task_vars
      debug:
        var: task_vars
      vars:
        task_vars: 20

    - name: print task_vars 2
      debug:
        var: task_vars
		
Execute vars_task_playbook.yml .

ansible-playbook vars_task_playbook.yml


A vars: in a task is a variable that is valid only in that task. Since priority of the variable in the task is higher than play vars , the second task will overwrite the value of the variable, resulting in the above.

Now let's check what happens if we use extra_vars (a variable specified from the command line), which has even higher priority.

To give extra_vars , run the ansible-playbook command with the -e option.

ansible-playbook vars_task_playbook.yml -e 'task_vars=50'

In all tasks, the value of extra_vars with the highest priority is used. As you can check, Ansible has different priorities for overwriting variables depending on where they are defined, so be careful.

Other Variable Definitions
Here are some other ways to define variables.

<u>Definition in set\fact</u>
[set_fact] (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/set_fact_module.html) module can be used to define arbitrary variables in a task part. A common use case is to receive the result of the execution of one task, process the value 
to define a new variable, and use the value in a subsequent task.

The exercise on using set_fact will be given in the next part.

Definition in host_vars, group_vars
These are the variables described in the inventory section. You can define variables to be associated with specific groups or hosts. In addition to writing them in the inventory file, you can also create a gourp_vars host_vars directory in the same directory 
layer as the playbook to be executed. By creating <group_name>.yml and <node_name>.yml files in the host_vars directory, Ansible make them recognized as group and host variables.

Note: The directory names gourp_vars host_vars are predefined in Ansible and cannot be changed
We will actually define some host variables and group variables.

group_vars/all.yml
Let's define the group variables.

---
vars_by_group_vars: 1000

host_vars/node01.yml
Define the host variables for node01.

---
vars_by_host_vars: 111

host_vars/node02.yml
Define the host variables for node02.

---
vars_by_host_vars: 222

host_vars/node03.yml
Define the host variables for node03.

---
vars_by_host_vars: 333

Check Variable Files
Let's check the files we have created so far.

tree group_vars host_vars

group_vars
└── all.yml     <- vars_by_group_vars: 1000
host_vars
├── node01.yml  <- vars_by_host_vars: 111
├── node02.yml  <- vars_by_host_vars: 222
└── node03.yml  <- vars_by_host_vars: 333

vars_host_group_playbook.yml
Let's create a playbook that uses these variables.

---
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: print group_vars
      debug:
        var: vars_by_group_vars

    - name: print host vars
      debug:
        var: vars_by_host_vars

    - name: vars_by_group_vars + vars_by_host_vars
      set_fact:
        cal_result: "{{ vars_by_group_vars + vars_by_host_vars }}"

    - name: print cal_vars
      debug:
        var: cal_result
		
When you are ready, execute vars_host_group_playbook.yml .

ansible-playbook vars_host_group_playbook.yml

(snip)
TASK [print group_vars] ******************************
ok: [node-1] => {
    "vars_by_group_vars": 1000
}
ok: [node-2] => {
    "vars_by_group_vars": 1000
}
ok: [node-3] => {
    "vars_by_group_vars": 1000
}

TASK [print host vars] *******************************
ok: [node-1] => {
    "vars_by_host_vars": 111
}
ok: [node-2] => {
    "vars_by_host_vars": 222
}
ok: [node-3] => {
    "vars_by_host_vars": 333
}

TASK [vars_by_group_vars + vars_by_host_vars] ********
ok: [node-1]
ok: [node-2]
ok: [node-3]

TASK [print cal_vars] ********************************
ok: [node-1] => {
    "cal_result": "1111"
}
ok: [node-2] => {
    "cal_result": "1222"
}
ok: [node-3] => {
    "cal_result": "1333"
}
(snip)
In this way, it is possible to have different values for different groups or hosts with the same variable name.

Save Execution Results by Register
Ansible modules return various return values when executed, and in the playbook, these return values can be saved for use in subsequent tasks. The register clause is used for this purpose, and if a variable name is specified in register , the return value 
will be stored in that variable.

Edit vars_register_playbook.yml as follows.

---
- hosts: node01
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: exec hostname command
      shell: hostname
      register: ret

    - name: print ret
      debug:
        var: ret

    - name: create a directory
      file:
        path: /tmp/testdir
        state: directory
        mode: '0755'
      register: ret

    - name: print ret
      debug:
        var: ret
Let's execute vars_register_playbook.yml .

ansible-playbook vars_register_playbook.yml

(snip)
PLAY [node01] *****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

        },

        "stdout_lines": [
            "node01"
        ]
    }
}

TASK [create a directory] *****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

TASK [print ret] **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [node01] => {
    "ret": {
        "changed": true,
        "diff": {
            "after": {
                "mode": "0755",
                "path": "/tmp/testdir",
                "state": "directory"
            },
            "before": {
                "mode": "0775",
                "path": "/tmp/testdir",
                "state": "absent"
            }
        },
        "failed": false,
        "gid": 1000,
        "group": "ubuntu",
        "mode": "0755",
        "owner": "ubuntu",
        "path": "/tmp/testdir",
        "size": 4096,
        "state": "directory",
        "uid": 1000
    }
}

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
node01                     : ok=4    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0


In this example, we first use the shell module to store the result of executing the hostname command in the variable ret , and display the contents in the debug module immediately after. 
Next, a directory is created using the file module and its return value is stored in ret . Then, the debug module is used to check the contents.

You can confirm what the return value of each module is in the module documentation.

The use of variables gives a lot of flexibility to the playbook.
