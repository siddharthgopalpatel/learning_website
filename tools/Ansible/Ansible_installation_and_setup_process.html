<html><h3>Ansible Intallation and setup steps</h3>
<pre><h4>
1. Go to AWS account -> Create 3 EC2 instances in same AZ.

2. Take access of all the machines via CLI(eg. putty  etc.). 

3. Now go inside ansible server and download ansible package (For RedHat servers etc.).
<mark>=> wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm </mark> 

4. Check the downloaded package after running ls commmand.

5. yum install epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm -y

6. yum update -y

7. Have to install all the packages one by one
<mark>=> yum install git python python-level python-pip openssl ansible -y</mark>

8. Go to hosts file and paste private ip of all the nodes

9. Now the hosts file is only working after updating the ansible configuration file,
<mark=> uncomment below mentioned lines 
a. inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts
b. sudo-user = root </mark>

10. Now create one user, in all the three instances.
<mark>=> adduser ansible</mark>

11. Set password the created user
<mark>=> passwd ansible</mark>

12. This ansible user doesn't have sudo priviledge right now, if you want to give sudo priviledge to ansible user
<mark>=> visudo
=> root ALL = (ALL) ALL
=> ansible ALL = (ALL) NOPASSED:ALL </mark>

14. Now do this thing in other nodes also. To test, Go to ansible server and try to install httpd package as a ansible user.
<mark>=> [ansible@ip] sudo yum install htppd -y</mark>

15. Now to establish connection b/w ansible server and node do some changes in sshd-config file and restart sshd service.

16. At the last generate the ssh keys on ansible server and copy the public key on all the nodes.
