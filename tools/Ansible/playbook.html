<html><h3><u>Playbooks</u></h3>
<h4><pre>

In the previous exercise, we used the Ad-Hoc command to execute the modules one by one, which is convenient in some situations.
However, when you are actually working on a project, you may need to execute several steps in succession, and executing the Ad-Hoc commands one after the other can be tedious. 
In the playbook, we describe the modules and parameters we want to call in order, and then execute them using ansible-playbook command to execute the contents of the playbook at once.

The first step in automating your infrastructure with Ansible is to create a playbook.


The playbook is written in YAML format, and the important points about YAML are described below.

YAML should be a text format for expressing data.
Files should start with --- .
Indentation has meanings.
Indentation should be written in space. tab will result in an error.
key : value makes it a dictionary format.
Can be converted to and from json

Below is the playbook samples.

---
- name: Deploy Apache server
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: first task
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest
  - name: second task
    service:
      name: apache2
      state: started
      enabled: yes

The playbook described in a json.

[
	{
		"hosts": "all",
		"become": "yes",
		"tasks": [
			{
				"name": "first task",
				"apt": {
					"name": "apache2",
					"state": "latest"
				}
			},
			{
				"name": "second task",
				"service": {
					"name": "apache2",
					"state": "started",
					"enabled": "yes"
				}
			}
		]
	}
]

Creating a playbook
Let's actually create a playbook. In this section, we will create a playbook to build a web server.

first_playbook.yml
play part, Please add the following to your file.

---
- name: Deploy Apache server
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  
The following is a description of what we have done here.

name: : This is the name of the process to be performed in this playbook. It can be omitted.
hosts: all : Specify the groups and nodes where the playbook will run. This must be a group or node that exists in the inventory you are using.
become: yes : This declares that the playbook will elevate privileges to a privileged user at runtime, the same as -b used in the ansible command.

This part is called the play part of the playbook, and it defines the overall behavior of the playbook. Understand it as a kind of header for the entire playbook.
Check the Official documentation for details for the items that can be specified in the play part. https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/playbooks_keywords.html#play

task part
Next, add the following to the previous file to achieve the following state. Please pay attention to the indentation hierarchy.

---
- name: Deploy Apache server
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install apache
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest

  - name: start & enabled apache
    service:
      name: apache2
      state: started
      enabled: yes

	  
The content added here is called the task part, and it describes the actual process to be performed by this playbook. In the task part, the modules are listed in the order in which they are to be 
invoked, and the necessary parameters are given to the modules.

tasks: Defines that what follows is a task part.
- name: ... A description of this task. Optional.
apt: and service: Specifies the module to invoke.
The following are the parameters given to the module.
name: apache2 state: latest
name: apache2 state: started enabled: yes

The modules that are invoked here are as follows.

apt : Used to install the apache package.
service : Used to start the installed apache and enable the auto-start setting.
You can check the created playbook for syntax errors with the following command

ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml --syntax-check

playbook: first_playbook.yml
The above is the error-free case. If there is an error in indentation, etc., it will look like this.

$ ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml --syntax-check

ERROR! Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  expected &lt;block end&gt;, but found '&lt;block sequence start&gt;'
 
The error appears to be in 'first_playbook.yml': line 6, column 2, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  tasks:
 - name: install apache
 ^ here
In this case, double-check that the indentation of the playbook is the same as in the sample.

<u>DRYRUN</u>

Check whether the playbook is formatted correctly.

ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml --check

Execute the playbook
Let's execute the playbook that was created. Use the ansible-playbook command to run the playbook. If successful, the apache server will start and you should be able to see the initial screen of apache.

ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml(paste it again)

PLAY [deploy apache server] **************************************************

node-2  : ok=3 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-3  : ok=3 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
If the output is as the above, access node-1,2,3 with a browser and see how the site works.

<u>Adding a task</u>
Add a task to distribute the top page of the site to the playbook you have created.

Open index.html in the editor.

Edit the file as following

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Apache is running fine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

In addition, edit first_playbook.yml as the following.

---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Deploy Apache server
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest

  - name: start & enable apache
    service:
      name: apache2
      state: started
      enabled: yes

  - name: Copy index.html
    copy:
      src: index.html
      dest: /var/www/html/

Once the editing is completed, let's run the playbook after performing the syntax check.

ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml --syntax-check

ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml

PLAY [deploy apache server] **************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ******************************************************
ok: [node-2]
ok: [node-3]
ok: [node-1]

TASK [install apache] ********************************************************
ok: [node-1]
ok: [node-3]
ok: [node-2]

TASK [start & enabled apache] ************************************************
ok: [node-2]
ok: [node-1]
ok: [node-3]

TASK [copy index.html] ******************************************************
changed: [node-1]
changed: [node-3]
changed: [node-2]

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************
node-1  : ok=4 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-2  : ok=4 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-3  : ok=4 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0

When the process is completed successfully, access the three nodes again with a browser. If the playbook was written correctly and works, you should see the contents of index.html that you just created.

<u>Idempotency</u>
The advantage of using Ansible modules is that the amount of description can be greatly reduced, but there are other advantages as well. And that is idempotency .

In this exercise, we ran ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml twice, when we install and start apache, and when we add the top page of the site. In other words, the task of installing and starting
apache is executed twice. However, there is no error in the second playbook execution. This is because Ansible's `idempotency' is working.

If you carefully check the results of the first run and the second run, you will notice a difference in the output results. The difference is whether the output is changed or ok for each process.

changed : Ansible ran the process and changed the state of the target host (Ansible actually configured it).
ok : Ansible tried to do something, but it didn't change the state of the host because it was already configured as expected (Ansible didn't do the configuration or didn't need to do it).
This is the idempotency power of Ansible: it knows before it runs whether the process you are about to perform needs to be performed or not.

Now let's run the playbook again, and think about what the states of the three tasks will look like before we run it.

ansible-playbook first_playbook.yml

PLAY [deploy apache server] **************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ******************************************************
ok: [node-3]
ok: [node-1]
ok: [node-2]

TASK [install apache] ********************************************************
ok: [node-2]
ok: [node-1]
ok: [node-3]

TASK [start & enabled apache] ************************************************
ok: [node-1]
ok: [node-2]
ok: [node-3]

TASK [copy index.html] ******************************************************
ok: [node-3]
ok: [node-1]
ok: [node-2]

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************
node-1  : ok=4 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-2  : ok=4 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-3  : ok=4 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0

All tasks should now be ok , and you can easily see the difference in results by lining up the last PLAY RECAP part of the playbook execution. Here you can compare how many tasks have been changed 
on each node. Please compare how many tasks have been changed at each node.

First execution(two tasks has been changed)

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************
node-1  : ok=3 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-2  : ok=3 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-3  : ok=3 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0

Second execution(one task has been changed)

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************
node-1  : ok=4 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-2  : ok=4 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-3  : ok=4 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0

Third execution(no changes)

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************
node-1  : ok=4 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-2  : ok=4 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
node-3  : ok=4 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0

Each module in Ansible is designed to take this idempotency into account, and by using this module, you can write automation easily and safely.

Note: However, not all modules in Ansible are guaranteed to be fully with idempotency. Some modules, such as shell, do not know what will be executed, and some modules may not be with idempotency in 
principle depending on the target of operation (NW devices or cloud environment).It is necessary for users to pay attention when using such modules.
