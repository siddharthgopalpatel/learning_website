<h3>Shared volumes in a Kubernetes Pod</h3>
-> In Kubernetes, you can use a shared Kubernetes Volume as a simple and efficient way to share data between containers in a Pod.
-> For most cases, it is sufficient to use a directory on the host that is shared with all containers within a Pod.
-> Kubernetes Volumes enables data to survive container restarts, but these volumes have the same lifetime as the Pod.
-> That means that the volume (and the data it holds) exists exactly as long as that Pod exists.
-> If that Pod is deleted for any reason, even if an identical replacement is created, the shared Volume is also destroyed and created a new.
-> A standard use case for a multi-container Pod with a shared Volume is when one container writes logs or other files to the shared directory, and the
   other container reads from the shared directory.

In this file (pods03.yaml) a volume named html has been defined. Its type is emptyDir, which means that the volume is first created when a Pod is assigned to a node, and
exists as long as that Pod is running on that node. As the name says, it is initially empty. The 1st container runs nginx server and has the shared volume mounted to the
directory /usr/share/nginx/html. The 2nd container uses the Debian image and has the shared volume mounted to the directory /html.
Every second, the 2nd container adds the current date and time into the index.html file, which is located in the shared volume. When the user makes an HTTP request to the
Pod, the Nginx server reads this file and transfers it back to the user in response to the request.
