<html><u><center><h2>Labels and Selectors</h2></center></u>
<h4><pre>
-> Labels are the mechanism you use to organize Kubernetes objects.
-> A label is a key-value pair, without any predefined meaning that can be attached to the objects.
-> Labels are similar to tags in AWS or git where you use a name to quick reference.
-> So you are free to choose labels as you need it to refer an environment which is used for dev, testing or production, refer a product group like Department A, Department B.
-> Multiple labels can be added to a single object.

<u>Label - Selectors</u>
-> Unlike name/UIDs, labels do not provide uniqueness, as in general, we can expect many objects to carry the same label.
-> Once labels are attached to an object we would need filters to narrow down and these are called as label selectors.
-> The api currently supports two types of selectors - Equality based and set based.
-> A label selector can be made of multiple requirements which are comma-separated.
-> There are two types of selector, Equality based and Set based

1. Equality based: (=,!=)
   a. Equal to (=) 
   -> kubectl get pods -l env=dev
   
   b. Not equal to (!=)
   -> kubectl get pods -l env!=dev
	
2. Set based: (in, notin and exists)
   a. In
   -> kubectl get pods -l 'env in (dev,test)'

   b. Notin
   -> kubectl get pods -l 'env notin (dev,test)'

   c. Exists

kubectl get pods -l 'env in (development, testing)'
kubectl get pods -l 'env notin (development, testing)'
kubectl get pods -l class=pods,myname=bhupinder
kubectl delete pods -l 'env in (development,testing)'

<u>Node - Selector</u>
-> One use case for selecting labels is to constrain the set of nodes onto which a pod can schedule i.e. you can tell a pod to only be able to run on particular nodes.
-> Generally such constraints are unnecessary, as the scheduler will automatically do a reasonable placement, but on certain circumstances we might need it.
-> We can use labels to tag nodes.
-> Once the nodes are tagged, you can use the label selectors to specify the pods run only of specific nodes.
-> First we give label to the node
-> Then use node selector to the pod configuration.
