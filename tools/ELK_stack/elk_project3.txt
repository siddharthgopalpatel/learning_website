Project 3 -

In this setup, we are using the Metricbeat system module, which is already enabled.

Load Metric Kibana Dashboards/Elasticsearch Index Template
You can load the recommended index template for writing to Elasticsearch and deploy the sample dashboards for visualizing the Metricbeat data in Kibana by executing the command below;
metricbeat setup -e -E setup.kibana.host=kibana:5601

-> Start the metricbeat service
service metricbeat start

====
Metricbeat

Theory
-> Elastic stack can be used to monitor Linux system metrics with the aid of the Metricbeat. 
-> Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper for system metrics. 
-> It can collect system-level CPU usage, memory, file system, disk IO, and network IO statistics, as well as top-like statistics for every process running on your systems and 
   ship them to Elasticsearch for indexing to enable visualization through the visualization tools like Kibana.
-> This Metricbeat system module collects the following metricsets;
   - cpu
   - load
   - memory
   - network
   - process
   - process_summary
   - socket_summary
   - entropy
   - core
   - diskio
   - socket
   - service
   - users
-> If you want to modify the module, simply open the file, /etc/metricbeat/modules.d/system.yml, for editing. 
=====
Debug 
-> Metricbeat ships with a dozen modules that enabled it to collect specific service metrics. You can list modules by running the command below;
metricbeat modules list (The command shows enabled and disabled modules)

-> To enable a module, simply run (Where a module-name you can obtain from the list above)
metricbeat modules enable <module-name>

-> Similarly, to disable a module
metricbeat modules disable <module-name>

-> Test Metricbeat configuration syntax;
metricbeat test config

-> Test Modules settings;
metricbeat test modules

-> Also, test Metricbeat output connection;
metricbeat test output
