<html><u><center><h2>Elastic Stack Introduction</h2></center></u>
<h4><pre>
-> Elastic Stack, previously known as ELK stack, comprises of four opensource major components, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash and Beats. 
-> These components can be used to collect, parse, store, search, analyze and visualize different types of logs collected from different types sources. To break down a bit -
-> Elasticsearch is an open source, distributed, RESTful, JSON-based search and analytics engine based on the Lucene library. It is one of the major components of Elastic (ELK) stack. 
-> Kibana is a data visualization and dash-boarding tool that enables you to analyze data stored on Elasticsearch.
-> Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then stashes it on search analytics engine like Elasticsearch
-> Beats on the other hand are the log shippers that collects logs from different endpoints and sends them to either Logstash or directly to Elasticsearch.
-> Logstash data processing pipeline has three sections;
     INPUT: input section is used to ingest data from different endpoints into Logstash. (Plugin: Beats)
     FILTERS: which processes and transform the data received. (Plugin: Grook)
     OUTPUT: which stashes processed data into a specified destination, which can be Elasticsearch. (Plugin: Elasticsearch)
-> You can read more about Logstash Pipeline here(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/7.0/pipeline.html)
-> While configuring Logstash, you can have separate configuration files each for INPUT, FILTERS and OUTPUT. You can as well have single configuration file for all the sections.
-> Filebeat is a lightweight shipper for collecting, forwarding and centralizing event log data. It is installed as an agent on the servers you are collecting logs from. 
-> It can forward the logs it is collecting to either Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing.
-> There are other types of Beats as described here(https://www.elastic.co/beats/)

-> Auditbeat is a lightweight data shipper that is used to collect audit events for users and system processes. 
-> It can also be used to detect changes to critical files, like binaries and configuration files, and identify potential security policy violations.
-> Auditbeat supports different modules including;
   System modules which collects various security related information about a system.
   Audit module which collect system audit events.
   File integrity module which collects system file changes that contain metadata and hashes.
