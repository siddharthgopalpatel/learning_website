<h4><pre>
-> A port can be defined as a logical entity in computer networking and software terms.
-> It acts as a communication endpoint for identifying a given process or application on the Linux operating system. 
-> A port is a 16-bit (0 to 65535) number that differentiates a single application from others on various end systems.
-> Two of the most famous Internet transport protocols, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and other protocols apply 
   port numbers for many sessions of communication (destination and source port numbers in conjunction with the destination and source IP addresses).
-> A combination of a protocol, port, and IP address like TCP/UDP is called a socket. 
-> It is necessary that all the services should have a specific socket.

Categories of Port
-> These ports are divided into three categories for ease of use because the variety of ports is large. 
-> All the categories are labeled as the port value range:
   0-1023: These ports are well-known and called "System" ports. They are reserved for the processes of the system that provide a huge range of network 
           services. A process should have the privileges of a superuser for binding with any "Well-known" port.

   1024-49151: These ports are "Registered" and called the "User" ports. They are designated via IANA for unique services. A process might have 
               authentication to them upon request. It does not need any privilege of a superuser for using these ports in the most systems case.

   49152-65535: These ports are "Dynamic" and called the "Private" ports. They can not be registered with IANA. These types of ports are open for using 
                for customized and private services and may also be allocated as the ephemeral ports (known as short-lived ports applied by IP) 
                automatically.
